  <h2 class='c005'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><em>Many readers have doubtless long been familiar with the
catalogs issued now and again by European publishers—no
bare lists of authors and titles, but such wholly charming productions
as, for example, the annual almanacks of the</em> Insel-Verlag
<em>of Leipzig. As I approached the conclusion of my first
five years’ publishing it seemed to me—in view of the uncommon
friendliness of so many readers—that they, at any rate,
would perhaps receive with favor a more permanent record of
the early activities of the Borzoi than it would be possible to
present in the usual sort of American publisher’s announcement.
Authors—may I say my authors?—greeted the idea
with such enthusiasm (how generous their coöperation the following
pages abundantly testify) that it soon took fairly definite
shape. The original papers are of course the real excuse
for</em> The Borzoi 1920, <em>while the balance of the book is
intended simply to be useful—to the individual reader, the
bookseller, and the librarian. I have tried to make the bibliography
complete, but the Who’s Who is confined to writers who
are, I hope, more or less definitely associated with my list
(and from whom I could get the necessary information).</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>My best thanks are due many for whatever success Borzoi
Books may have achieved. Those, first, who wrote them, and
especially the generous contributors to this volume; the booksellers,
who have been both friendly and intelligent in their
coöperation; the critics who have been for the most part both
understanding and encouraging; the loyal co-workers in my
own office; and last, but not least, the readers who have made
the whole venture possible.</em></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>[The following—reprinted from the <cite>Athenæum</cite> (London) of June
11th, 1920, and translated by S. Kotliansky is part of Gorky’s preface
to the first catalogue of “World Literature,” the publishing house
founded by him under the auspices of the Bolshevik government. It is
reprinted here as a plea, as noble as it is typical of Gorky, for good
books.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it necessary to speak of the necessity of a serious study
of literature, or at least of a wide acquaintance with it? Literature
is the heart of the world, winged with all its joys and
sorrows, with all the dreams and hopes of men, with their
despair and wrath, with their reverence before the beauty of
nature, their fears in face of her mysteries. This heart throbs
violently and eternally with the thirst of self-knowledge, as
though in it all those substances and forces of nature that
have created the human personality as the highest expression
of their complexity and wisdom aspired to clarify the meaning
and aim of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Literature may also be called the all-seeing eye of the world,
whose glance penetrates into the deepest recesses of the human
spirit. A book—so simple a thing and so familiar—is,
essentially, one of the great and mysterious wonders of the
world. Some one unknown to us, sometimes speaking an incomprehensible
language, hundreds of miles away, has drawn
on paper various combinations of a score or so of signs, which
we call letters, and when we look at them, we strangers, remote
from the creator of the book, mysteriously perceive the meaning
of all the words, the ideas, the feelings, the images; we
admire the description of the scenes of nature, take delight
in the beautiful rhythm of speech, the music of the words.
Moved to tears, angry, dreaming, sometimes laughing over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>the motley printed sheets, we grasp the life of the spirit, akin
or foreign to ourselves. The book is, perhaps, the most complicated
and mightiest of all the miracles created by man on
his path to the happiness and power of the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no one universal literature, for there is yet no
language common to all, but all literary creation, in prose
and poetry, is saturated with the unity of feelings, thoughts,
ideals shared by all men, with the unity of man’s sacred aspiration
towards the joy of the freedom of the spirit, with the
unity of man’s disgust at the miseries of life, the unity of his
hopes of the possibility of higher forms of life, and with the
universal thirst for something indefinable in word or thought,
hardly to be grasped by feeling, that mysterious something
to which we give the pale name of beauty, and which comes to
an ever brighter and more joyous flower in the world, in our
own hearts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may be the inward differences of nations, races,
individualities, however distinct may be the external forms
of states, religious conceptions and customs, however irreconcilable
the conflict of classes—over all these differences,
created by ourselves through centuries, hovers the dark and
menacing spectre of the universal consciousness of the tragic
quality of life and the poignant sense of the loneliness of man
in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rising from the mystery of birth, we plunge into the mystery
of death. Together with our planet we have been thrown
into incomprehensible space. We call it the Universe, but we
have no precise conception of it, and our loneliness in it has
such an ironical perfection that we have nothing with which
to compare it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loneliness of man in the Universe and on the earth,
which is to many “a desert, alas! not unpeopled”—on earth
amid the most tormenting contradiction of desires and possibilities—is
realized only by few. But the faint feeling of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>is implanted in the instinct of nearly every man like a noxious
weed, and it often poisons the lives of men who appear to be
perfectly immune from that murderous nostalgia which is
the same for all ages and peoples, which tormented equally
Byron the Englishman, Leopardi the Italian, the writer of
“Ecclesiastes,” and Lao-Tse, the great sage of Asia.</p>

<p class='c000'>This anguish that arises from the dim sense of the precariousness
and tragedy of life is common to great and small, to
every one who has the courage to look at life with open eyes.
And if a time is to come when men will have overcome this
anguish and stifled in themselves the consciousness of tragedy
and loneliness, they will achieve that victory only by the way
of spiritual creation, only by the combined efforts of literature
and science.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides its envelope of air and light all our earth is surrounded
with a sphere of spiritual creativeness, with the multifarious
rainbow emanation of our energy, out of which is
woven, forged or moulded all that is immortally beautiful;
out of which are created the mightiest ideas and the enchanting
complexity of our machines, the amazing temples and tunnels
that pierce the rock of great mountains, books, pictures, poems,
millions of tons of iron flung as bridges across wide rivers,
suspended with such miraculous lightness in the air—all the
stern and lovely, all the mighty and tender poetry of our life.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the victory of the mind and will over the elements of
nature and the animal in man, striking out ever brighter
sparks of hope from the iron wall of the unknown, we men
can speak with legitimate joy of the planetary significance
of the great efforts of our spirit, most resplendently and
powerfully expressed in literary and scientific creation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great virtue of literature is that by deepening our consciousness,
by widening our perception of life, by giving shape
to our feelings, it speaks to us as with a voice saying: All
ideals and acts, all the world of the spirit is created out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>the blood and nerves of men. It tells us that Hen-Toy, the
Chinaman, is as agonizingly unsatisfied with the love of woman
as Don Juan, the Spaniard; that the Abyssinian sings the same
songs of the sorrows and joys of love as the Frenchman; that
there is an equal pathos in the love of a Japanese Geisha and
Manon Lescaut; that man’s longing to find in woman the
other half of his soul has burned and burns with an equal flame
men of all lands, all times.</p>

<p class='c000'>A murderer in Asia is as loathsome as in Europe; the Russian
miser Plushkin is as pitiable as the French Grandet; the
Tartufes of all countries are alike, Misanthropes are equally
miserable everywhere, and everywhere every one is equally
charmed by the touching image of Don Quixote, the Knight
of the Spirit. And after all, all men, in all languages, always
speak of the same things, of themselves and their fate. Men
of brute instincts are everywhere alike, the world of the intellect
alone is infinitely varied.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a clearness irresistibly convincing, fine literature gives
us all these innumerable likenesses and infinite varieties—literature,
the pulsing mirror of life, reflecting with quiet sadness
or with anger, with the kindly laugh of a Dickens or
the frightful grimace of Dostoevsky, all the complications of
our spiritual life, the whole world of our desires, the bottomless
stagnant pools of banality and folly, our heroism and
cowardice in the face of destiny, the courage of love and the
strength of hatred, all the nastiness of our hypocrisy and the
shameful abundance of lies, the disgusting stagnation of our
minds and our endless agonies, our thrilling hopes and sacred
dreams—all by which the world lives, all that quivers in the
hearts of men. Watching man with the eyes of a sensitive
friend, or with the stern glance of a judge, sympathizing with
him, laughing at him, admiring his courage, cursing his nullity—literature
rises above life, and, together with science, lights
up for men the paths to the achievement of their goals, to
the development of what is good in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>At times enchanted with the beautiful aloofness of science,
literature may become infatuated with a dogma, and then we
see Emile Zola viewing man only as a “belly,” constructed
“with charming coarseness,” and we also see how the cold
despair of Du Bois Reymond infects so great an artist as
Gustave Flaubert.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious that literature cannot be completely free from
what Turgeniev called “the pressure of time”; it is natural,
for “sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.” And it may
be that the evil of the day poisons more often than it should
the sacred spirit of beauty, and our search for its “inspirations
and prayers”; these inspirations and prayers are poisoned by
the venomous dust of the day. But “the beautiful is the
rare,” as Edmond Goncourt justly said, and we most certainly
often consider lacking in beauty and insignificant habitual
things—those habitual things which, as they recede into the
past, acquire for our descendants all the marks and qualities
of true, unfading beauty. Does not the austere life of ancient
Greece appear to us beautiful? Does not the bloody, stormy
and creative epoch of the Renaissance with all its “habitual”
cruelty enrapture us? It is more than probable that the great
days of the social catastrophe we are going through now will
arouse the ecstasy, awe and creativeness of the generations that
will come after us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor let us forget that though Balzac’s “Poor Relations,”
Gogol’s “Dead Souls,” “The Pickwick Papers,” are essentially
books that describe conditions of actual life, there is hidden
in them a great and imperishable lesson which the best university
cannot provide, and which an average man will not have
learnt so exactly or so clearly after fifty years of hard-working
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The habitual is not always banal, for it is habitual for man
to be consumed in the hell fire of his vocation, and this self-consumption
is always beautiful and necessary, as it is instructive
for those who timidly smoulder all their life long, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>blazing up in the bright flame that destroys the man and
illuminates the mysteries of his spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Human errors are not so characteristic of the art of the word
and image; more characteristic is its longing to raise man
above the external conditions of existence, to free him from
the fetters of the degrading actuality, to show him to himself
not as the slave, but as the lord of circumstance, the free
creator of life, and in this sense literature is ever revolutionary.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the mighty effort of genius rising about all circumstances
of actuality, saturated with the spirit of humanity, kindling
its hatred from the excess of passionate love, fine literature,
prose and poetry, is our great vindication, and not our condemnation.
It knows that there are no guilty—although
everything is in man, everything is from man. The cruel contradictions
of life that arouse the enmity and hatred of nations,
classes, individuals, are to literature only an inveterate error,
and she believes that the ennobled will of men can and must
destroy all errors, all that which, arresting the free development
of the spirit, delivers man into the power of animal
instincts.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you look closely into the mighty stream of creative
energy embodied in the word and image, you feel and believe
that the great purpose of this stream is to wash away for
ever all the differences between races, nations, classes, and,
by freeing men from the hard burden of the struggle with
each other, to direct all their forces to the struggle with the
mysterious forces of nature. And it seems that then the art
of the word and image is and will be the religion of all mankind—a
religion that absorbs everything that is written in
the sacred writings of ancient India, in the Zend-Avesta, in
the Gospels and Koran.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Claude Bragdon</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I must protest against the movies, though I be stoned to
death for it in the middle of Longacre Square.</p>

<p class='c000'>My sight is either jaundiced or clairvoyant: which, I leave
the reader to decide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strip life of its color, mystery, infinitude; make it stale,
make it grey, make it flat; rob the human being of his aura,
deny him speech, quicken his movements into galvanic action;
people a glaring parallelogram with these gigantic simulacra
of men and women moved by sub-human motives; drug the
tormented nerves with music, so that the audience shall not go
mad—this is the movie as it is to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other day I read a panegyric on the most beautiful of
all moving pictures. I forced myself to sit through it though
I could scarcely forbear shrieking aloud. It was an amusement
seemingly devised for devils in hell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only degradation of the soul and a vast despondency result
from this seeking joy in the pictured suffering wickedness,
weakness of others; in this orgy of sex-sentimentality, silliness,
meaningless violence. Such amusement either depraves the
mind or arrests its action, and makes of the heart a mechanical
toy which must be shaken violently before it will act.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why do people go to the movies? Because their caged souls
seek forgetfulness and joy as insistently as blind eyes yearn
for light. But joy is such a stranger to them that they ignorantly
mistake this owl-eyed Monster of Darkness for the
Blue Bird of Happiness. I have asked many why they go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the movies, and have heard many reasons—most of them bad—but
one answer recurs like a refrain: “There isn’t any
thing else to do.” It reminds me of John Russel’s reason why
Eliza (of Uncle Tom’s Cabin) crossed the river on the ice.
“The poor girl had no other place to go—all the saloons
were closed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Today all the saloons are closed, and professional philanthropy
prides itself on the fact that more men go now to the
movies. The saloon was an evil institution, but the prostitution
of the mind is worse than any poisoning of the nerves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The priests of the temple of the Movie Momus do not know
that they are offering a form of amusement which stifles the
mind and hardens the heart. Doubtless they believe the contrary,
but it is a case of the blind led by the blind: Neither
know where they are going, and each depends upon the other
to lead the way. Producers, impresarios, scenario-writers
have always their ears to the ground to catch the first faint
rumble of condemnation or approval. Their business is
frankly to assimilate the popular taste in order to reproduce it.
But this taste is fickle, being that of a child with a digestion impaired
by too much of the wrong kind of food. The movie
public is like the Athenian populace always eager for “some
new thing,” and like the Roman mob it shows an insatiable
greed for danger (to others) cruelty and destruction. Of daring
it demands more daring; of beauty more nudity; of wickedness
a deeper depth of wickedness; scenery must be ever
more sumptuous, orgies more orgiastic, violence more violent.
Lacking anything to turn its imagination away from these
things, into some new channel, the public can only build high
and higher this particular house of cards.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a great deal talked and written about the “educational
value” of the movies, and this acts as a deterrent to
many persons who are minded, as I am, to denounce this evil
in the market place. But such deceive themselves with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>word “education,” forgetting that mankind is <em>one</em>. In order
that some may learn easily a few merely physical facts, such
people countenance and support an institution that eats at the
very heart of the spirit of man.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hear in anticipation the crushing argument against my
point of view: The Movies constitute the fourth largest industry
in the world; they command the respect of governments,
the service of the press, the participation of captains of
industry, cabinet members, international bankers. But all this
is quite beside the point, and reminds me of the answer once
given to my criticism of an absurd soldiers’ monument: “It
cost fifty thousand dollars and was carved out of a single piece
of granite that weighed ten tons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Movies too are carved out of a single piece of granite:
the granite of ignorance of the obscure spiritual forces now
active in the secret hearts of men.</p>

<p class='c000'>On a vast scale, in infinite variety of detail, the Movies
show</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The very age and body of the time its form and pressure.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>May not the unforeseen, amazing, ultimate result be to recoil
in horror from the image there presented? The Movies
represent the quest of joy aborted. Perhaps their true purpose
is to bring bitter, but salutary knowledge.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>MAXWELL BODENHEIM</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Witter Bynner</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>While poets have been placed by the critics in this or that
category and have lent themselves more or less to the indignity,
Maxwell Bodenheim has continued as he began, a poet of disturbing
originality. Whether you like him or not, you cannot
evade him. Let him once touch you and a perfume is
upon you, pungent and yet faint, offensive and yet delicate, of
the street and yet exotic. It is as if Pierian springs bubbled
crystalline from the nearest sewer, forcing from you a puzzled
and troubled enjoyment. It is as if a diamond leered or
a rose exhaled sulphur or a humming-bird lanced your self-respect.
It is a drunken thief’s hand, still deft, in the poetic
treasury; nuances pouring Niagaran; sensibilities crowding in
masquerade; madness mocking sanity; ideas dancing nude
through confetti; a falsetto growl; a whispered song; a rainbow
in the loose:—and yet, all the while a human eye watching
the incredible kaleidoscope, an eye that sees and makes
you see likewise, good and evil, beauty and pain, opposing
and commingling their designs. Historically Bodenheim’s
work is likely to share with Donald Evans’ very different
“Sonnets from the Patagonian” the distinction of having
initiated in American poetry for better or worse the season and
influence of fantastic impressionism. Evans has now become
almost orthodox, his green orchid is put away; but Bodenheim
still wears in his lapel the coloured ghost of a butterfly-wing
whose veinings mock at human progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>One is sometimes asked about the “obstacles” that confront
young writers who are trying to do good work. I should
say the greatest obstacles that writers today have to get over,
are the dazzling journalistic successes of twenty years ago,
stories that surprised and delighted by their sharp photographic
detail and that were really nothing more than lively
pieces of reporting. The whole aim of that school of writing
was novelty—never a very important thing in art. They
gave us, altogether, poor standards—taught us to multiply
our ideas instead of to condense them. They tried to make a
story out of every theme that occurred to them and to get returns
on every situation that suggested itself. They got returns,
of a kind. But their work, when one looks back on it,
now that the novelty upon which they counted so much is
gone, is journalistic and thin. The especial merit of a good
reportorial story is that it shall be intensely interesting and
pertinent today and shall have lost its point by tomorrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Art, it seems to me, should simplify. That, indeed, is very
nearly the whole of the higher artistic process; finding what
conventions of form and what detail one can do without and
yet preserve the spirit of the whole—so that all that one
has suppressed and cut away is there to the reader’s consciousness
as much as if it were in type on the page. Millet had
done hundreds of sketches of peasants sowing grain, some of
them very complicated and interesting, but when he came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>paint the spirit of them all into one picture, “The Sower,” the
composition is so simple that it seems inevitable. All the discarded
sketches that went before made the picture what it
finally became, and the process was all the time one of simplifying,
of sacrificing many conceptions good in themselves for
one that was better and more universal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any first rate novel or story must have in it the strength
of a dozen fairly good stories that have been sacrificed to it.
A good workman can’t be a cheap workman; he can’t be stingy
about wasting material, and he cannot compromise. Writing
ought either to be the manufacture of stories for which there
is a market demand—a business as safe and commendable as
making soap or breakfast foods—or it should be an art,
which is always a search for something for which there is no
market demand, something new and untried, where the values
are intrinsic and have nothing to do with standardized values.
The courage to go on without compromise does not come to a
writer all at once—nor, for that matter, does the ability.
Both are phases of natural development. In the beginning,
the artist, like his public, is wedded to old forms, old ideals,
and his vision is blurred by the memory of old delights he
would like to recapture.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>I have a friend who, when she hears a strange voice on the
telephone, can visualize the person—that is to say, she sometimes
can, if it interests her. She half-closes
her eyes, tilts her head back,
stares away off into space; and then
she slowly describes the appearance of
whoever is telephoning, almost as
well as though he or she were standing
before her. It is one of those supernatural gifts that seem
to our times so startling.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_024b.jpg' alt='French Academician' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The reason I mention this is, that though I hadn’t supposed
I was that sort of person, I had one of these mysterious psychic
visions myself, years ago. It came to me while I was reading
Mr. Knopf’s first announcements of books. I had never seen
the man, never heard a word of what he was like, yet his
image suddenly arose clear as a photograph before my inner
eye. There he stood, tall and thin, an elder statesman,
with a bushy white beard; round, glowing
eyes, ivory skin; an animated savant.</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke in his circulars as a man of great taste
and authority. I pictured him as a French Academician
of American birth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Year by year as I read his new catalogs this
image grew stronger. People would ask me, “Have you met
this man Knopf?” and I would say: “No, I haven’t, but I
can tell you what he’s like just the same. I’m a bit of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>psychic.” And then I would describe my strange vision. This
sometimes annoyed them: they would even ask, “But how do
you <em>know</em>?” I would then describe the sense of quiet certitude
that comes with such an experience.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='I found he had changed' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then one evening I met Mr. Knopf—in the flesh, as we
phrase it. I found he had changed. He was more human,
and in a way more impressive, but less picturesque.
Instead of being tall and thin he
was of medium-size, strong, and well-formed.
And he wasn’t exactly what you’d call old:
in fact he was in his twenties; and instead
of a bushy white beard, he had only a small
black moustache.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not for me to explain this astonishing and almost incredible
discrepancy. I must leave that to the Psychical Research
Society, to which I wish all success. The only way
I can account for it is to suppose that Mr. Knopf has more
than one personality. I admit I did not see in my vision the
side he physically presents to the world. But it may be I
am such a powerful psychic that I saw something deeper. I
saw the more appropriate vehicle of his innermost soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>We sat down for a talk. I tried out of courtesy not to use
this power of mine any further. Even when I gave him my
manuscript to publish, and we began to talk terms, I endeavoured
not to peer into his heart. He gave me good terms however.
He explained that his idea of a publishing house was a
sort of a companionable enterprise, and that authors and publishers
ought to be friends. They at least ought to try.</p>

<p class='c000'>I carefully looked over his list to see who his author-friends
were, and picked out one or two pretty rum ones and asked
him about them. He admitted with composure that of course
every man made mistakes. I said anxiously that I hoped I
had made none in choosing him as my publisher. He said
probably not; but it was harder for him to pick out the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>authors. He added however that he had done very well—up
to now.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stared thoughtfully at each other....</p>

<p class='c000'>I glanced at his list again. It did consist chiefly of quality
belles lettres, after all. He really seemed to care about books.
But then I wondered suspiciously if the very fact of his being
so cultivated had made him a poor man of business. His appearance
was certainly forceful and energetic, but nevertheless—</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_026.jpg' alt='In spite of his bitter objections' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>I decided to have one more vision. I half-closed my eyes,
the way that friend of mine does, and tilted my head back.
Mr. Knopf seemed surprised. I paid no attention to this,
but coolly gazed right into his mind. It was a tall, roomy
mind, with long rows of thoughts, like onions on rafters—thoughts
of bindings and dogs and Archimedes and authors
and what-not. In the middle was a huge pile of packing cases
(mostly unopened) containing his plans and ambitions in the
publishing world. I am sorry now I didn’t unpack a few to
see what they were, but they looked pretty solid; and I was
distracted by seeing, way over in a corner, his thoughts of myself.
As these were at that time rather mixed, I prefer not to
describe them. My catching sight of them at all was merely
one of those unhappy annoyances that must often upset a
seer’s life. It’s one of the risks of the business.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I gazed on, indignantly, something
drew across his mind like a truck, only
even more massive. I presently discerned
that it was a large strong intention to go.
Simultaneously—for the man is well coordinated—he
said good-bye and went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was left there alone in my rooms, with my weird psychic
gift. I may add that after a brief contemplation of it, I rang
for the janitor, and in spite of his bitter objections, transferred
it to him.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>MAX BEERBOHM</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Floyd Dell</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The very name of Max Beerbohm carries the mind back to
the time when he first emerged as a literary figure—the time
of the Yellow Book—the time of Whistler’s letters and Swinburne’s
newest poem, of velvet jackets and plush knee-breeches,
and foot-in-the-grave young poets who caroused mournfully at
the sign of the Bodley Head. But it was above all the period
of the Enoch Soameses who are celebrated by Max Beerbohm
in his latest volume, “Seven Men”—an age of strange young
Satanists who would be content with nothing less than founding
a new English literature upon the cornerstone of their
own thin sheaves of unintelligible poems. They are dead,
now—they got tired of waiting for their immortality to begin—and
forgotten, except for the wreaths of tender and
ironic phrases which Max Beerbohm lays from time to time
on their graves. He survives them, the Last of the Esthetes.
And yet Enoch Soames would say bitterly that it was just like
Fate that the Last of the Esthetes should be a man who never
was an Esthete at all!</p>

<p class='c000'>And there is something to the Enoch Soames point of view.
Max Beerbohm’s title to Estheticism is rather precarious. His
words may be the words of Dorian Grey, but the laughter behind
them is surely the laughter of Huck Finn! Yes, under
the jewelled stylistic cloak of Max Beerbohm, what do you
find but the simple-hearted amusement of a healthy child?
From the story of the Young Prince in “The Complete Works
of Max Beerbohm,” to the celebrated Bathtub passage in
“Zuleika Dobson,” the whole effect consists in the sudden substitution
of the obvious for the recherché. You thought you
were going to have to pretend to enjoy pickled nightingale’s
tongues, and you find—greatly to your relief—that it is just
ice-cream-and-cake!</p>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_028b.jpg' alt='Clarence Day Jr.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>And yet his style cannot be said to be mere masquerade.
Max Beerbohm, it is hardly to be doubted, loves the magic
of word and phrase and rhythm as devoutly as any pure soul
who ever took opium in an attic for art’s sake.</p>

<p class='c000'>I like to think of Max Beerbohm as a boy who ran away to
sea and was captured and brought up by a band of pirates.
The pirates, you understand, are that romantic crew who embarked
under the Yellow flag upon a career of ruthless literary
destruction in the ‘Nineties, at a time when it seemed that
the deeps of literature were given over to a peaceful and profitable
traffic in morals and ethics, pieties and proprieties and
puerilities. What havoc they did create! The royal Victorian
navy, for all its literary big guns, was helpless against
them. It was not, in fact, until Captains Gilbert and Sullivan
sailed out against them in the good ship <em>Patience</em> that they
received any serious setback! And if we go to the log-books of
Gilbert and Sullivan for further information about this particular
adventure, we shall find it, I think, in “The Pirates of
Penzance”—where the tender and confident relations of the
virtuous young hero and his piratical captors may serve as an
illuminating picture of young Max Beerbohm in piratical captivity
among the Esthetes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He learned his manners from them; and a more graceful
band of literary desperadoes never existed. Nothing could exceed
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</span> with which they scuttled the traditions and
made the familiar virtues walk the fatal plank. And so it is
that when we read Max Beerbohm today, the superb gallantry
of his style suggests that he is going to commit a felonious
assault upon our most treasured ideals. But he never does.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>You are stopped by a gun-shot across your bow, and you prepare
for the worst. But the worst is merely a jolly invitation
in a boyish voice to a game of marbles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The combination is irresistible.... I am reminded of an
authentic tale of the South seas. A band of wicked mutineers
set their captain and officers afloat in an open boat, and sailed
to Pitcairn Island, where they proceeded to live in the most
Nietzschean fashion imaginable, enslaving the natives, taking
their wives away from them, and living in fabulous luxury.
They were a fractious lot, however, and they quarrelled among
themselves, and shot each other up, and went insane and committed
suicide, until the natives got tired of it, and revolted
and killed them all—all except one gentle person who had
got mixed up with the mutineers by mistake. He was not a
Nietzschean; he believed at heart in all the old-fashioned virtues.
And where the Nietzscheans had failed, he succeeded—so
notably that when the island was rediscovered half a century
later, he was ruling there in a little peaceful paradise,
the Last of the Mutineers. There is something about gentleness,
it would seem, that makes for survival. And I like to
think that Max Beerbohm remains with us to tell the story
of quaint, devil-worshipping literary mutineers like Enoch
Soames, precisely because he cannot bear ever to press home
the shining blade of his wit to its most deadly extent—because
he does not really want to hurt anybody after all, not
even Enoch Soames.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>JOSEPH HERGESHEIMER</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Wilson Follett</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>I</h4>

<p class='c016'>When Mr. Knopf asked me to pay my brief respects to
Joseph Hergesheimer, he must have been aware that I had not
the material for an intimate portrait. He and my other readers
must forgive me, then, if what I shall have to say tallies
rather better with the exigencies of formal public criticism
than with the more delightful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convenances</span></i> of this altogether
jolly family party. After all, there is a certain advantage—especially
for a person of amiably weak will—in knowing an
author’s public aspects better than his private and personal.
I cannot profess to be of those austere souls who can criticize
the book of a friend as if he were not a friend, or, knowing and
liking a man, can read or appraise his books uninfluenced by a
charm which would still exist even if the books did not. Because
of this distrusted weakness of my own temper, I insist
on being glad that I never met or even saw Joseph Hergesheimer
until “The Three Black Pennys” had become a solid
part of my awareness of things—the things that do most
richly signify. I never had any reason to think well—or ill—of
this author until the Pennys and “Gold and Iron” had exerted
their swift effortless compulsion. Even now, I can lay
claim to no more than what the biographic essayist calls, in
his standard idiom, a “literary friendship”—meaning thereby
the occasional exchange of abysmally polite letters on purely
impersonal subjects or personal subjects impersonally dealt
with.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>II</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yet even I have my one sufficiently quaint, sufficiently spicy
reminiscence. And meet it is I set it down—partly because it
seems too precious to die, even more because otherwise, as time
shuffles the cards of our mortal anecdotage, it will be sure to
turn up, with only the substitution of one name for another,
as part of the mythos surrounding the late Jack London, or
Richard Harding Davis, or some still flourishing nominee for
an epitaph and an official biography.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was three o’clock of a rainy summer morning in 1918.
Hergesheimer and your present scribe were sleeping—or
rather we were not—in the twin beds of a guest-room at
San-Souci, in Hartsdale. A Nox Ambrosiana had been put
behind us, and, we fatuously supposed, a few hours of ambrosial
sleep lay ahead. It had been a great night, dedicated
to much fine talk of Art, and as free from “the posings and
pretensions of art” as Conrad’s Preface to “The Nigger.” But
that is not the story.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somewhere in the blackness under our opened windows,
vocal in his forlornness, was Bistri, the flesh-and-blood original
of the borzoi whose mere inadequate outline appears on a really
amazing proportion of the most distinguished books now being
published in These United States—or, if your literary capital
be Arnold Bennett’s, Those United States. This Bistri, a perfectly
incredible yet perfectly actual milk-white creature of
enormous size, decorative as a dryad, but possessed of something
less than half a gill of brains within his extremely dolichocephalic
head, was frank to assert—and reiterate—his
disapproval of the pelting rain and his cynical disillusionment
in respect to the kindly graces of humankind. The sound was
like the ululating whimper of a punished child, only it hinted
no promise of subsiding, ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Genius, supine in the dark across the room, grew first restive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>then indignant, then furious, and thence, passing round the
circle of exhausted emotions, came back by the way of despair
to a disgusted silence. Not so Bistri: silence was the last
thing to fall within the orbit of his intentions, so long as the
Master and Maker of dogs vouchsafed him breath and being.
Gradually the silence of genius, there across the room, acquired
a subtly grim texture. When next the voice of genius
spoke, it was tensely, with suppressed ferocity, as through
clenched teeth. What it said was this: “<em>I’ll bet Scribner has
got no such damned dog.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest, after Gargantuan laughter, was silence.... Ah,
but was it, quite? Or did the speaker of these words, also
deeming them too precious to die, retail them at late breakfast
to the mistress of the borzoi, even as their sole hearer presently
reported them at earlier breakfast to the borzoi’s master? It
would be interesting to know—and not very surprising either
way.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>III</h4>

<p class='c016'>So far the record of a personal and temperamental susceptibility,
of some incidental interest, perhaps, to the curious.
What remains to speak of is the deeper susceptibility of which
Mr. Hergesheimer’s books are the record, and which runs
through all his public work, a determining law and a binding
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">continuum</span></i>; that enormous and delicate susceptibility to sights,
sounds, forms, colours, movements, aspects, which is at once
his purpose and his effect, his unconscious excuse for being
and his conscious claim to self-justification. He might say, in
the words of a document already referred to, and important in
the history of fictional art: “My task which I am trying to
achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you
hear, to make you feel—it is, before all, to make you see.
That—and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you
shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>consolation, fear, charm—all you demand and, perhaps, also
that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We can all see now, with the glib wisdom of after the event,
that Mr. Hergesheimer’s career before its one sharp early
break is—comparatively—all promise, and after that break—comparatively—all
performance. In “The Lay Anthony”
and “Mountain Blood” one finds a slight uneasiness or unevenness
of recital, the result, I think, of a subconscious
attempt to make the manner dignify and sanction two
performances not, in matter, quite good enough to receive that
ultimate sanction, style. With and after “The Three Black
Pennys,” and very specially in “Java Head” and “Wild
Oranges,” which remain thus far the masterpieces of perfect
formal integrity, this discrepancy is lost from the reckoning.
The artist has an exigent discrimination of that which is good
enough for him to touch, and his touch upon it is exquisite.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in one respect, the betrayal of a born artist’s susceptibility,
the works of promise are at one with the works of performance.
The man who could not help going out of his
way, in “The Lay Anthony,” to allude to “Heart of Darkness”
as “the most beautiful story of our time,” was simply predestined
to write a book of which susceptibility to beauty should
actually be the theme—as he did in “Linda Condon.” And
the man who, in “Java Head,” achieved so supreme a saturation
with the aromas and essences of loveliness, had prefigured
his own future when, in “Mountain Blood,” he wrote: “The
barrier against which he still fished was mauve, the water
black; the moon appeared buoyantly, like a rosy bubble blown
upon a curtain of old blue velvet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just here, in the crystallization of his own sensitivity into
the objective forms of beauty, lies the peculiar distinction of
Hergesheimer. It is an aristocratic distinction. It is, if you
go by the counting of tastes, a distinctly un-American trait.
This fact it is, rather than any less fundamental consideration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which explains—even if it does not justify—those critics
who even before they discover how to divide his name properly
into syllables, discover that there is something slightly
exotic about him. Exotic or autochthonous—what does it
matter? The point is, Mr Hergesheimer’s power “to make
you hear, to make you feel ... before all, to make you
see” is the condition of his success as a coiner of beauty. It
is also his way, whatever way another artist may take, to reveal
to us those glimpses of deep truth for which we may,
indeed, have forgotten to ask, but for which, once they are
opened to our sight, we can never forget to be grateful.</p>

    <div><em>By A. P. Herbert</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is commonly said that everybody can sing in the bathroom;
and this is true. Singing is very easy. Drawing,
though, is much more difficult. I have devoted a good deal of
time to Drawing, one way and another; I have to attend a
great many committees and public meetings, and at such functions
I find that Drawing is almost the only Art one can satisfactorily
pursue during the speeches. One really cannot sing
during the speeches; so as a rule I draw. I do not say that
I am an expert yet, but after a few more meetings I calculate
that I shall know Drawing as well as it can be known.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing, of course, is to get on to a really good committee;
and by a good committee I mean a committee that provides
decent materials. An ordinary departmental committee
is no use: generally they only give you a couple of pages of
lined foolscap and no white blotting-paper, and very often the
pencils are quite soft. White blotting-paper is essential. I
know of no material the spoiling of which gives so much artistic
pleasure—except perhaps snow. Indeed, if I was asked
to choose between making pencil-marks on a sheet of white
blotting-paper and making foot-marks on a sheet of white snow
I should be in a thingummy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much the best committees from the point of view of material
are committees about business which meet at business premises—shipping
offices, for choice. One of the Pacific Lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>has the best white blotting-paper I know; and the pencils there
are a dream. I am sure the directors of that firm are Drawers;
for they always give you two pencils, one hard for doing
noses, and one soft for doing hair.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 1</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When you have selected your committee and the
speeches are well away, the Drawing begins. Much
the best thing to draw is a man. Not the chairman,
or Lord Pommery Quint, or any member of the committee,
but just A Man. Many novices make the mistake
of selecting a subject for their Art before they
begin; usually they select the chairman. And when they find
it is more like Mr. Gladstone they are discouraged. If they had
waited a little it could have been Mr. Gladstone officially.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i_038b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As a rule I begin with the forehead and work down
to the chin (Fig. 1).</p>

<p class='c000'>When I have done the outline I put in the eye.
This is one of the most difficult parts of Drawing;
one is never quite sure where the eye goes. If, however,
it is not a good eye, a useful tip is to give the
man spectacles; this generally makes him a clergyman,
but it helps the eye (Fig. 2).</p>

<p class='c000'>Now you have to outline the rest of the head, and this is
rather a gamble. Personally, I go in for <em>strong</em> heads (Fig.
3).</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_038c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 3</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I am afraid it is not a strong neck; I expect
he is an author, and is not well fed. But that is
the worst of strong heads; they make it so difficult
to join up the chin and the back of the neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next thing to do is to put in the ear; and
once you have done this the rest is easy. Ears
are much more difficult than eyes (Fig. 4).</p>

<p class='c000'>I hope that is right. It seems to me to be a little too far

  <h3 class='c001'>A NOTE ON THE CHINESE POEMS TRANSLATED BY ARTHUR WALEY<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Joseph Hergesheimer</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is the special province of poetry, as of charming women,
to delight rather than afford the more material benefits. Nothing
could be vainer than putting either of them to the rude
uses of life; they are the essence of aristocracy; and the indifference,
the contempt really, with which the mass of people
regard poetic measures, and conversely, the disdain of charm
for the whole common body of opinion, show clearly the wide
separation between prosaic fact and fancy. The former has
the allegiance of the mob, as it should, since, without imaginative
sensibility, the mechanical process of existence is a stupid
multiplication of similar instincts; while fancy, poetry, beauty,
the properties of delicate minds and aspirations, are, by the
very qualities necessary to their being, limited to a select few.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were ages, long submerged now by the obliterating
tide of progress, when poetry was, generally, a force in men’s
lives; and then, as well, women’s beauty was held above their
mere animality; but the levelling democracy of Christian religions,
lending a new power to the resentment and suspicions
of congregations of the inferior, ended perhaps for ever reigns
of distinction. Yet, ironically, while sects vanished over night
and fanatics were denied even the final distinction of martyrdom,
while great empires sank leaving no ripple on the surface
of memory, stray lines of wanton poetry, the record of
lovely bodies, remained imperishable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>They were deathless—such frivolities as the Trojan Helen
and the words Sappho strung from her loneliness—because
they were the inalienable property of the heart ... the clamorous
dogmas were nothing more than the pretentions of anthropomorphic
vanity. But that, with its tinsel promises and
brimstone threats, a sentimental melodrama, gathered the audiences,
the credulity, of humanity, and left unattended the
heroic performance of naked beauty. This, at its best, was a
sheer cool cutting of marble; but there was another beauty,
hardly inferior, where embroidered garments and carmine and
jade, both hid and revealed less simple but scarcely less significant
emotions.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this reason, while Ionic Greece is no longer a part of
modern consciousness, the poem written by the sixth emperor
of the Han dynasty, perhaps two thousand years ago, is
identical with the present complex troubled mind: an autumn
wind rises and white clouds fly, the grass and trees wither,
geese go south—sadly he remembers his love and the pagoda-boat
on the Fēn River. That, particularly, is the singular
validity of the Chinese poems translated by Mr. Waley; page
after page they are the mirror of the splintered colours, the
tragic apprehensions and sharp longing, of a later unhappiness.
Already, then, China was old and civilized, its philosophers
had analysed hope into maxims of stoical and serene conduct;
and its poetry was written in an unsurpassable dignity of
repression.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latest imagery, nothing in the world if not visual in
perceptions of utmost fragile truth, is not so acute in observation
and artifice as the song, in the second century, of Sung
Tzu-hou. (She sees the fruit trees in blossom and, forgetting
about her silkworms, begins to pluck the branches.) And no
contemporary, it may be no Western, poet has approached the
reflective cadences, the refrain of memory steeped in longing,
that gives the lines of Po Chü-i their magic semblance to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>wistful and fleet realities of mind. He has, but in greater degree,
Verlaine’s power to invest lovely frivolities with permanence;
an ability Arthur Symons occasionally brushed.
His Old Harp, of cassia-wood and jade stops and rose-red
strings, neglected for the Ch’iang flute and the Ch’in flageolet,
vibrates with a tenderness of ancient forgotten melodies beyond
any evocation of the Fêtes Galantes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poetry of those dynasties and men, however, aside from
everything else, is made timeless, for us, by the celebration
of its women, the wives, the concubines, the dancers of Hantan.
They were, objectively, inconceivably different from the
woman of today; yet the passions, the fidelity, they inspired,
a little attenuated by the dust of centuries, are precisely the
same which the heart retains. The Chinese women have always
served an ideal of personal beauty, of correct formality,
transcending any other: in May their satins are worked with
the blossoms of spring and in October with chrysanthemums.
Socially they occupied the women’s gardens—a position now
regarded with contempt—but they were not, because of that,
inferior. They dominated the masculine imagination and
provided, together with music, the recompense of existence
checkered by the dark squares of fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, too, as many wives praised as dancers summoned,
as much constancy as there is incontinent pleasure. An emperor
sends to all parts of China for wizards, hoping that they
may bring back the spirit of his mistress. The General Su An,
absent on service, begs the woman with whom his hair was
plaited not to forget the time of their love and pride. Indeed,
on the other side, in the poetry there is a marked restraint: the
dancers are a stiff frieze in peacock blues and orange and
gold behind the fragrant vapours of incense.</p>

<p class='c000'>All is tranquillized, even the battle pieces are softened as
though in distance, and the satire, often pungent and universal,
is subdued by the realization of its uselessness. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>wine, in cups and jars, and drunkenness: Po Chü-i returns
home, leaning heavily on a friend, at yellow dusk; but there
are no raised voices or disturbance; and, soothed by the swallows
about the beams, a candle flame in the window, the moon
crowning the tide, he hears only the music of flutes and strings.
There are roc and phoenix and red jungle fowl, ibis and
cranes and wild swan along the river; women with bright lips
sway to the silver tapping of their bells, ladies, long of limb,
enter with side glances under moth eye-brows, and after them
others with faces painted white, their deep sleeves reeking
with scent. But they are only momentary; they are left, plucking
vainly at the coats of those who will not stay, and the
pure dawn holds a mango-bird singing among flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are poems that dwell on the green of mulberry trees
and fields of hemp, on the oxen in the village streets, the burnished
pools of carp, the lotus banks and rice furrows and
glittering fret of snow. And there, equally, they are completely
in the mood, or, rather, perfections of the attempted
mood, of the present. In English lyrical poetry alone, and
that, except for John Masefield, the beauty of yesterday and
not today, have the settings of life been so beautifully refashioned.
An ability of long habited lands; for its power is
not in described nature, but the love of a particular soil—feathery
bamboo at the door, a hollow of daffodils, are symbols
not so much of recurrent seasons as of a deep-rooted passionate
attachment for the city of Lo-yang or for the Devon
sod. Without sincerity of human emotion words are no better
than broken coloured glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the United States ever becomes civilized and develops a
literature, no doubt the Middle West will be the scene of the
prodigy. The two coasts are washed by too many paralysing
and distracting waves. Boston, after three hundred years, remains
a mere suburb of London, timorous, respectable and
preposterous—a sort of ninth-rate compound of Putney and
Maida Vale. New York is simply a bawdy free port, without
nationality or personality. As for San Francisco, New
Orleans, Philadelphia and Baltimore, once so saliently individual,
they scarcely exist any longer, save for banking, political
and census purposes. But in the Middle West the authentic
Americano is still a recognizable mammal, and shows
all his congenital spots, particularly upon the psyche. More,
he has become introspective and a bit conscience-stricken, and
so begins to analyse and anatomize himself. The fruits are
“The Spoon River Anthology,” the novels of Norris and
Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson’s terrific tales, the Little Theatre
business, Lindsay and his uneasy college yells, George Ade
and his murderous satire, Willa Cather and her poignant evocation
of the drama of the prairie. Count out Hergesheimer
and Cabell and you will scarcely find an imaginative writer
doing genuinely sound work—that is, an imaginative writer
of the generation still squarely on its legs—who is not from
beyond the Alleghenies. Chicago is the centre of the new
writing fever, as it is the centre of nearly all other native
fevers.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Four or five years ago, though she already had a couple of
good books behind her, Willa Cather was scarcely heard of.
When she was mentioned at all, it was as a talented but rather
inconsequential imitator of Mrs. Wharton. But today even
campus-pump critics are more or less aware of her, and one
hears no more gabble about imitations. The plain fact is
that she is now discovered to be a novelist of original methods
and quite extraordinary capacities—penetrating and accurate
in observation, delicate in feeling, brilliant and charming in
manner, and full of a high sense of the dignity and importance
of her work. Bit by bit, patiently and laboriously, she has
mastered the trade of the novelist; in each succeeding book she
has shown an unmistakable advance. Now, at last, she has
arrived at such a command of all the complex devices and
expedients of her art that the use she makes of them is quite
concealed. Her style has lost self-consciousness; her grasp of
form has become instinctive; her drama is firmly rooted in a
sound psychology; her people relate themselves logically to
the great race masses that they are parts of. In brief, she
knows her business thoroughly, and so one gets out of reading
her, not only the facile joy that goes with every good story,
but also the vastly higher pleasure that is called forth by first-rate
craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='c000'>I know of no novel that makes the remote folk of the western
farmlands more real than “My Antonía” makes them, and I
know of none that makes them seem better worth knowing.
Beneath the tawdry surface of Middle Western barbarism—so
suggestive, in more than one way, of the vast, impenetrable
barbarism of Russia—she discovers human beings bravely embattled
against fate and the gods, and into her picture of their
dull, endless struggle she gets a spirit that is genuinely heroic,
and a pathos that is genuinely moving. It is not as they see
themselves that she depicts them, but as they actually are.
And to representation she adds something more—something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that is quite beyond the reach, and even beyond the comprehension
of the average novelist. Her poor peasants are not
simply anonymous and negligible hinds, flung by fortune into
lonely, inhospitable wilds. They become symbolical, as, say,
Robinson Crusoe is symbolical, or Faust, or Lord Jim. They
are actors in a play that is far larger than the scene swept by
their own pitiful suffering and aspiration. They are actors
in the grand farce that is the tragedy of man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Setting aside certain early experiments in both prose and
verse, Miss Cather began with “Alexander’s Bridge” in 1912.
The book strongly suggested the method and materials of Mrs.
Wharton, and so it was inevitably, perhaps, that the author
should be plastered with the Wharton label. I myself, ass-like,
helped to slap it on—though with prudent reservations,
now comforting to contemplate. The defect of the story was
one of locale and people: somehow one got the feeling that
the author was dealing with both at second-hand, that she
knew her characters a bit less intimately than she should have
known them. This defect, I venture to guess, did not escape
her own eye. At all events, she abandoned New England in
her next novel for the Middle West, and particularly for the
Middle West of the great immigrations—a region nearer at
hand, and infinitely better comprehended. The result was “O
Pioneers” (1913), a book of very fine achievement and of
even finer promise. Then came “The Song of the Lark”
(1915)—still more competent, more searching and of even
finer promise. Then came “The Song of the Lark” (1915)—still
more competent, more searching and convincing, better
in every way. And then, after three years, came “My Antonía,”
and a sudden leap forward. Here, at last, an absolutely
sound technique began to show itself. Here was a novel
planned with the utmost skill, and executed in truly admirable
fashion. Here, unless I err gravely, was the best piece of
fiction ever done by a woman in America.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>I once protested to Miss Cather that her novels came too far
apart—that the reading public, constantly under a pressure of
new work, had too much chance to forget her. She was
greatly astonished. “How could I do any more?” she asked.
“I work all the time. It takes three years to write a novel.”
The saying somehow clings to me. There is a profound criticism
of criticism in it. It throws a bright light upon the difference
between such a work as “My Antonía” and such a
work as—.... But I have wars enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carl Van Vechten’s mental gesture is more or less unique in
American literature. His work has about as much relation
to what might be considered the “serious classical output”
of writing today as irresistible footnotes have to filling an
all too fulsome history. Whereas the bulk of the intellectual
page of contemporary American writing is for the most part
of transitional importance Mr. Van Vechten’s essays are replete
with the delightful essence of what is importantly transitory.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a critic of the fine arts and other things, his range is not
so immense as it is extraordinary. How can one keep on the
hat of appreciation before the work of a writer who improvises
as adroitly about cats as about <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prima donne</span>, who in
one book tells the only authoritative story of the music of
Spain, in another makes or breaks the fame of some famous
player and in still another goes far afield to bring into the
glow of his praise some hidden personage from some remote
and delicious byway of life and letters? If he mounts into
his garret to unopen ancient chests and write of olden things,
he doesn’t neglect at the same time to look from his high
window at what is going on about him. In the midst of the
gorgeous hurry of New York he hears the quieter melody of
far off places. He is a cosmopolitan critic and at the same
time a critic of cosmopolis.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Music is never very far from his pages. He is acknowledged
as one of the most important of the musical critics in
America because he has had the wise wisdom of not writing
about music at all. He is one of the few musically informed
who has sensibly refrained from any vacant analysis of tonal
mysteries, one of the very few indeed who realizes the futility
of filling soundless books with sounding but empty treatises on
sound. He has had the rare and modest grace of letting music
sing or play or “symphonize” for itself. His chief concern
has been with interpretations and interpreters. Taking the
one or the other as his theme he has written critical variations
and the result has been critical creation.</p>

<p class='c000'>His work has the quality of rare, spontaneous and intriguing
talk. There is about his writing an air of delicate and urbane
gossip, a knowledge and thought that does not take itself in
any sense or at any moment as too profound to admit of a
digression into gaiety. It is not so much what he knows as
the very particular and personal way in which he knows it.
His one cliché is a desperate detestation of all critical clichés.
The woof of his thought is a charming destroyal of all accepted
standards, the web of his thinking is a delicate but
constructive anarchy. When he builds up we are grateful,
when he tears down we are equally grateful because he always
leaves behind him the intricate, infernally informed and fascinating
machinery of his annihilation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the monthly department, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Répétition Générale</span>,” which
we jointly conduct in <cite>The Smart Set Magazine</cite>, there was some
months ago incorporated the following paragraph:</p>

<p class='c018'>“When one of us, in the course of his critical writings,
indulges himself in polite words about the other, it is a
common antic of the newspaper literary supplement professors
to observe that this encomium is merely by way
of mutual log-rolling, that it is based upon no sounder
critical ground than our friendship for each other and
our commercial alliance, and that it is perhaps not honestly
believed in by either the one or the other. This, of
course, is idiotic. We are friends and partners, not because
we admire each other’s beauty, or each other’s conversation,
or each other’s waistcoats or wives, but because
we respect each other professionally, because each to the
other seems to know his work in the world, and how to
do it, and how to do it—it may be—just a little bit
better than the next nearest man. This, obviously, is the
soundest of all bases for friendship. It is not friendship
that makes men approve one another; it is mutual approval
that makes them friends.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Let me add a word about Mencken in particular. I respect
him, and am his friend, because he is one of the very few
Americans I know who is entirely free of cheapness, toadyism
and hypocrisy. In close association with him for more than
twelve years, I have yet to catch him in a lie against himself,
or in a compromise with his established faiths. There have
been times when we have quarrelled and times, I dare say,
when we have hated each other: but when we have met again
it has been always on a ground of approval and friendship
made doubly secure and doubly substantial by the honesty of
his point of view (however wrong I have held it), by the
wholesomeness of his hatred, and by his frank and ever self-doubting
conduct at our several Appomattoxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps no man has ever been more accurately mirrored by
his writings than this man. He has never, so far as I know,
written a single line that he hasn’t believed. He has never
sold a single adjective—and there have been times when
opulent temptations have dangled before him. And on certain
of these occasions he could have used the money. There may
be times when he is wrong and when his opinions are biased—I
believed that there are not a few such times—yet if he is
wrong, he is wrong honestly, and if he is biased, he neither
knows it in his own mind nor feels it in his own heart. He is
the best fighter I have ever met. And he is the fairest, the
cleanest, and the most relentless.</p>

<p class='c000'>But does he accept himself with forefinger to temple, with
professorial wrinkles, as an Uplifting Force, a Tonic Influence?
Not on your ball-room socks! No critic has ever
snickered at him as loudly and effectively as he snickers at
himself. “What do you think of your new book?” I usually
ask him when he has finished one. And his reply generally
is, “It’s got some good stuff in it—and a lot of cheese.
What the hell’s the use of writing such a book, anyway? My
next one....”</p>

<p class='c000'>Life to him is a sort of Luna Park, and he gets the same
sort of innocent, idiotic fun out of it. He would rather drink
a glass of good beer than write; he would rather talk to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>pretty girl than read; he would rather wallop the keys of a
piano than think; he would rather eat a well-cooked dinner
than philosophize. His work, which so clearly reflects him
spiritually, represents him equally clearly in helpless revolt
against his corporeal self.</p>

<p class='c000'>This; a snapshot of Henry Mencken, for ever applying the
slapstick to his own competence, constantly sceptical of his
own talents, and ever trying vainly to run away from the pleasure
that his temperament rebelliously mocks. I am happy to
know him, for knowing him has made the world a gayer place
and work a more diverting pastime. I am glad to be his partner,
his collaborator, his co-editor, his drinking companion,
and his friend. For after all these many years of our friendship
and professional alliance, there is only one thing that
I can hold against him. For ten years he has worn the damndest
looking overcoat that I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many years ago it was my<a id='t37'></a> privilege to know a sturdy, forthright
Judge who had, in his own youth, faced a jury upon a charge
of murder. He had attempted no shifty, technical defence,
but admitted frankly that he had killed a man, and had the
best of reasons for having done so. The jury agreed with him
and set him free, to sentence many another less fortunate
creature, during his long and honoured career on the bench.
I remember how often I used to wonder as I watched him
meting out punishments whether he ever meditated upon his
own narrow escape. If he did, it never seemed to temper his
severity. He was there to deal out what he felt sure was justice,
and the closed pages of his own personal history had
nothing at all to do with his appraisement of the degrees of
guilt or innocence of the culprits who stood before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one who, like myself, has committed the crime of
authorship and afterwards presumes to sit in judgment upon
the art of fiction is in a position somewhat analogous to that
of my old friend, the Judge. It is true my own sins of this
character have been few and obscure. Nevertheless, they
must have been marked by the Recording Angel, and underscored
with a sinister emphasis, since the Recording Angel has
also for many generations coquetted with the business of professional
book-making.</p>

<p class='c000'>And my plea must be precisely that of this same militant
Judge. After all, it’s not a bad excuse. Today’s criminal is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>no less red-handed because of the indelible stain we succeed
in hiding so neatly under our own well-fitting glove.</p>

<p class='c000'>One can afford carelessly to ignore the cheap jibes of those
who insist on the obvious and meaningless taunt: “Why
don’t you write as you say you would have other American
fictionists write?” with the equally obvious retort that, if any
author really succeeded in writing the book of which he
dreamed, it would mean no more than that his dream was a
tawdry, worthless thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is enough for me, at least, to know what I wish to embody
in my own writings, no matter how far short of success
I may fall in the endeavour, or how certainly my adherence to
my own beliefs may cost me the interest of a public in whose
commendation I would find a healthy, human enjoyment, provided
always, I could have it without compromise.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe, then, that fiction is something vastly more than a
medium of amusement. I believe it has been, in all countries
and ages, that art best fitted to interpret life to the human beings
who share that life. I think it can be and should be
made a revelation of man’s emotion, impulse and character.
To me, it seems that any and every phase of human life, any
and every choice of scene and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</span> is worthy of
the fictionist’s study, and his only inflexible obligation is to
paint life as he sees it instead of sophisticating his tints and
outlines to portray what he would prefer seeing, or to depict
what he thinks his readers would like to see, or, worst of all,
to prove some pet thesis. I hold it as fundamental that, if
one can give an understanding picture of any phase of life,
no matter how trivial it may be intrinsically, he has contributed
something to the comprehension of the most important
of all things—Men and Women.</p>

<p class='c000'>By his very choice of fiction as his mode of expression, the
author is committed to some sense of form. He has acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>also the duty of telling some kind of a story which
shall not prove unbearably dull to the sensitive and alert
reader. If he has no story at all, he is an essayist in an ill-fitting
disguise. If he cannot or will not endeavour to interest
some portion of the public, he might as well keep a
diary and secure it under lock and key; but the writer holds
himself and his art too cheaply who makes no demands whatever
upon his reader. A fictionist’s public has no right to a
predigested diet, or to a menu skilfully arranged to give it
only what it happens to enjoy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unless the author has something actually craving utterance,
there is no excuse for his intrusion into a world already well
provided with printed matter, and if he feels this impulse for
expression he cannot satisfy it if he expresses the conception
of his critics, his publishers, or that inarticulate abstraction
called the public. If speaking his own thought, the public
will not buy his wares, then it must go without them, and he
must earn his bread in another fashion. But if this public
chooses to traffic with him at all, it must do so upon his terms
and at the price of some little effort upon its own part. If
the reader will expend no such energy to gain a new idea or a
new point of view regarding those ideas, then the thing he attempts
to assimilate so easily will, after all, profit him nothing.
The author is not the servant of his public. He is a
man with something to say. If passers-by choose to listen—good.
If they prefer to ignore him, he may not therefore seek
some more alluring jingle of words to catch their fancy. If
he descends to such devices he is a mere brother of the mountebank.
He must paint truth as he sees it even if he realizes
that other and better men cannot accept his pictures as truth.
It is not his function to reproduce other men’s images, whether
better or worse than his own. He must be austere to deny himself
the luxury of preaching. If his work is what it ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>to be, the reader may be stimulated to fashion out his own
deductions, but the hedonist who sets out to point a moral,
usually ends most immorally by distorting a character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Last of all—for here lies the vital differences between the
work of a mere honest craftsman and a true artist,—I should
like to hope that in my pages, I might now and then capture
some gleam of beauty—beauty of form, or of thought, or of
comprehending insight. For without this, fiction is a thing of
effort, dead and mechanical, however well intentioned. But
beauty is the gift of the capricious gods, and no one by taking
thought, or by the exercise of weary toil can feel sure of counting
it among his treasures.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the city itself you probably know all about it, and
wish you had never heard of it. As for me I had been in it
so often that my mouth didn’t get so dry on wet days, when
walking up that Sinister Street from Suicide Corner to what
was once the Cloth Hall. There I was, one summer day, in a
silence like deafness, amid ruins which might have been in
Central Asia, and I, the last man on earth, contemplating them.
There was something bumping somewhere, but it wasn’t in
Ypres, and no notice is ever taken in Flanders of what doesn’t
bump near you. So I sat on the disrupted pedestal of a forgotten
building and smoked, and wondered why I was in the
city of Ypres, and why there was a war, and why I was a fool.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a lovely day, and looking up at the sky over what
used to be a school dedicated to the gentle Jesus, which is
just by the place where one of the seventeen-inchers has blown
a forty-foot hole, I saw a little round cloud suddenly appear
in the blue, and then another, and then lots in a bunch, the
sort of soft little cloudlets on which Renaissance cherubs rest
their chubby hands, and with fat faces on one side consider
mortals from cemetery monuments. Then came down dull
concussions from the blue, and right over head I made out two
Boche ‘planes. A shell case banged the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</span></i> near me and
went on to make a white scar on a wall. Some invisible things
were whizzing about. One’s own shrapnel is often tactless.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>There was a cellar and I got into it, and while the intruders
were overhead I smoked and gazed at the contents of the cellar—the
wreckage of a bicycle, a child’s chemise, one old boot, a
jam pot, and a dead cat. Owing to an unsatisfactory smell
of many things I got out soon and sat on the pedestal again.</p>

<p class='c000'>A figure in khaki came straight at me across the square,
his boots sounding like the deliberate approach of Fate in
solitude. It stopped, saluted, and said, “I shoodden stay ‘ere,
sir. They’ve been gitten sights, and they gen’ally begin about
now. Sure to drop some ‘ere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At that moment a mournful cry went over us, followed by a
crash in Sinister Street. My way home! Some masonry fell
in sympathy from the Cloth Hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Better come with me till it blows over, sir. I’ve got a
dug-out near.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We turned off sharp, and not really before it was time to
move, into a part of the city unknown to me. There were
some unsettling noises, worse no doubt because of the echoes,
behind us; but it is not dignified to hurry when you look like
an officer. You ought to fill your pipe. I did so, and stopped
to light it. Once I paused in drawing it, checked by the
splitting open of the earth in the first turning to the right and
the second to the left, or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a big ‘un, sir,” said my soldier, who then took half
a cigarette from his ear, and a light from my match: we then
resumed our little promenade. By an old motor bus, whose
windows were boards, whose colour was War-Office neuter, but
who, for memory’s sake, still bore on its forehead the legend
“Liverpool Street,” my soldier hurried slightly, and was then
swallowed up. I was alone. While looking about for possible
openings, I heard his voice under the road, and then saw
a dark mouth, low in a broken wall, and crawled in. Finding
my way by touching the dark with my forehead and my shins,
I found a lower smell of graves hollowed by a candle and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>bottle. And there was my soldier, who provided me with an
empty case, and himself another, and we had the candle between
us. On the table was a tin of condensed milk suffering
from shock, and some documents under a shell-nose. Pictures
of partly clad ladies began to dimmer from the walls through
the gloom. Now and then the cellar trembled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where’s that old ‘bus come from?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! the pore old bitch, sir,” said the soldier sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, of course, but what’s the matter with her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s done in, sir. But she’s done her bit, she has,” said
my soldier, changing the crossing of his legs. “Ah! little did
she think when I used to take ‘er acrorse Ludgit Circus what a
‘ell of a time I’d ‘ave to give ‘er some day. She’s a good ole
thing. She’s done ‘er bit. She won’t see Liverpole Street
no more. If Milertery Medals wasn’t so cheap, she ought to
‘ave one, she ought.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cellar had a shocking fit of the palsy, and the candlelight
shuddered and flattened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ruddy swine are <em>ruddy</em> wild today. Suthin’s upset
‘em. ‘Ow long will this ruddy war last, sir?” asked the soldier,
slightly plaintive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know,” I said. “It’s filthy. But what about your old
‘bus?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! What about ‘er. She ain’t ‘arf ‘ad a time. She’s
seen enough war to make a general want to go home and shell
<em>peas</em> the rest of ‘is life. What she knows about it would make
all them clever fellers in London who reckon they know all
about it turn green if they heard a door slam. Learned it
all in one jolly old day too. Learned it sudden, like you
gen’ally learns things you don’t forgit afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I reckon I ‘adn’t anything to find out, either, not
after Antwerp. It only shows—Don’t tell me, sir, war
teaches yer a lot. It only shows fools what they don’t know
but might ‘ave guessed if they ‘adn’t been fools.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“You know Poperhinge. Well, my trip was between there
an’ Wipers, gen’ally. The stones on the road was enough to
make her shed nuts and bolts by the pint. But it was a quiet
journey, take it all round, and after a cup o’ tea at Wipers I
used to roll home to the garage. War? It was easier than
the Putney route. Wipers was full of civilians. Shops all
open. Estaminets and nice young things. I used to like war
then better than a school boy likes Sat’d’y afternoons. It
wasn’t work and it wasn’t play. And there was no rule you
couldn’t break if you ‘ad sense enough to come to attention
smart an’ answer quick. Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew so little about war then that I’m sorry I never
tried to be a milertary expert. But my education was neglected.
I can only write picture postcards. It’s er pity.
Well, one day it wasn’t like that. Not by a damn sight. It
dropped on Wipers, and it wasn’t like that a bit. It was
bloody different. I wasn’t frightened, but my little inside was.</p>

<p class='c000'>“First thing was the gassed soldiers coming through. Their
faces were green and blue, and their uniforms a funny colour.
I didn’t know what was the matter with ‘em, and that put the
wind up, for I didn’t want to look like that. What the ‘ell
was up? We could hear a fine rumpus in the Salient. The
civies were frightened, but they stuck to their homes. Nothing
was happening there then, and while nothing is happening it’s
hard to believe it’s going to. After seeing a Zouave crawl by
with his tongue hanging out, and his eyes like a choked dog’s,
and his face the colour of a mottled cucumber, I said good-bye
to the nice lady where I was. It was time to see about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And fact is I didn’t ‘ave much time to think about it; what
with gettin’ men out and gettin’ reinforcements in. Trip
after trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I shall never have a night again like that was till all
I’ve ever done is called out loud, and I get thumbs down on the
last day. Believe me, it was a howler. I steered the old ‘bus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>but it was done right by accident. It was certainly touch and
go. I shoodden ‘ave thought a country town, even in war,
could look like Wipers did that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was gettin’ dark on my last trip in, and we barged into
all the world gettin’ out—and gettin’ out quick. And the
guns and reinforcements were comin’ up behind me. There’s
no other road in or out, as you know. I forgot to tell you
that night comin’ on didn’t matter much, because the place
was alight, and the sky was bursting with shrapnel, and the
high explosives were falling in the houses on fire, and spreading
the red stuff like fireworks. It was like driving into a
volcano. The gun ahead of me went over a child, but only
its mother and me saw that, and a house in flames ahead of
the gun got a shell inside it, and fell on the crowd that was
mixed up with the army traffic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I got to a side turning I went up, and hopped off
to see how my little lady was getting on. A shell had got her
estaminet. The curtains were flying in little flames through
the place where the windows used to be. Inside, the counter
was upside down, and she was lying among the glass and bottles
on the floor. I couldn’t do anything for her. And further
up the street my headquarters was a heap of bricks, and the
houses on both sides of it alight. No good looking there for
any more orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Being left to myself, I began to take notice. While you’re
on the job you just do it, and don’t see much of anything else,
except with the corner of yer eye. I’ve never ‘eard such a
row, shells bursting, houses falling, and the place was chock
full of smoke, and men you couldn’t see were shouting and
women and children, wherever they were, turning you cold to
hear them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was like the end of the world. Time for me to hop it.
I backed the old ‘bus and turned her, and started off. Shells
flashed in front and behind and overhead, and, thinks I, next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>time you’re bound to get caught in this shower. Then I found
my transport officer, ‘is face going in and out in the red light.
‘E was smoking a cigarette, and ‘e told me my job. ‘E gave
me my cargo. I just ‘ad to take ‘em out and dump ‘em.
‘Where shall I take ‘em, sir?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Take ‘em out of this, take ‘em anywhere, take ‘em where
you damn like, Jones, take ‘em to hell, but take ‘em away,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I loaded up. Wounded Tommies, gassed Arabs, some
women and children, and a few lunatics, genuine cock-eyed
loonies, from the asylum. The shells chased us out. One
biffed us over on to the two rear wheels, but we dropped back
on four on the top speed. Several times I bumped over soft
things in the road, and felt rather sick. We got out o’ the
town with the shrapnel a bit in front all the way. Then the
old ‘bus jibbed for a bit. Every time a shell burst near us
the lunatics screamed and laughed and clapped their hands,
and trod on the wounded. But I got ‘er going again. I got ‘er
to Poperhinge. Two soldiers died on the way, and a lunatic
had fallen out somewhere, and a baby was born in the ‘bus;
and me with no ruddy conductor or midwife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I met our chaplain, and says he: ‘Jones, you want a drink.
Come with me and have a Scotch syrup.’ That was a good
drink. I ‘ad the best part of ‘arf a bottle without water, an’
it done me no ‘arm. Next mornin’ I found I’d put in the night
on the parson’s bed in me boots, and ‘e was asleep on the
floor.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>[<span class='sc'>To Alfred A. Knopf, Jr.</span>]</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>By Carl Van Vechten</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The disadvantages of being born on any day at all are sufficiently
obvious, and every mortal must occasionally experience
moments of envy for those vice elementals who exist in
the eldritch fourth dimension outside the limits of Time and
Space. But there are certain days on which it seems particularly
unpleasant and discouraging to be born: Christ’s
birthday, for instance, whose sharers must face the fate of
either receiving their Christmas presents on their birthday or
else their birthday presents on Christmas, and the twenty-ninth
of February, which by some is not regarded as a day at
all. Any cold day in Winter is sufficiently cheerless in a land
where Rum Punch, Mulled Claret, and Tom and Jerry are not
to be readily procured; any hot day in Summer is scarcely
suitable for celebration in a country which prohibits the sale
of Amer Picon, Sloe Gin, and White Absinthe. No one really
wants to be born in the Spring, which is a period of hope, or
in the Autumn, which is a season of death and depression. I
could, indeed, find many reasons for not being born on three
hundred and sixty-four days. Fortunately there is one day in
every year which is in every way worthy of being a birthday.</p>

<p class='c000'>I say in every way, and then I remember that John Wesley
was born on this day ... but that, after all, was probably an
accident. Nor do I linger over the name of Charles Gounod,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>but the birth of Igor Stravinsky on June 17 was pre-ordained.
There have been those who have chosen this as a suitable date
on which to die: Joseph Addison on June 17, 1719, and
Henrietta Sontag (in Mexico), on June 17, 1854. The Battle
of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17, 1775, and the Battle of
Waterloo on June 18 (not 1775!) so that the celebrated ball
held on its eve, described so vividly in <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> fell on the
seventeenth. And Abraham Lincoln was nominated on this
day in 1860.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Saints of the day bear fascinating, if somewhat unfamiliar,
names: Nicander and Marcian, Saint Prior, Saint
Avitus, Saint Botolph, Saint Molingus or Dairchilla. I like to
think that some child carries one of these names, or that several
children respectively carry them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Stars are friendly. Gemini, the Twins, of the Air
Triplicity, are in power. Mercury is the governing planet.
The Astral Colours are Red, White, and Blue, which permit
the child the choice of several patriotisms or gently dedicate
him to polyglottism. The cabalistic stones of the day are blue,
beryl, acquamarine, lapis lazuli, chalcedony, and sapphire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Twins endow those who fall under their sign with a
genius for vacillation. They symbolically indicate a dual
temperament, the eternal struggle between Psyche and Eros,
which nowadays is of such interest to Freudian professors that
these savants are said to pray many long hours each night that
more children shall be born between May 20 and June 21.
In the children of the Gemini one trait of character contradicts
another. These lads wish to travel and they wish to stay
at home. They are nervous and phlegmatic, happy and unhappy,
serious and frivolous, satisfied and dissatisfied, affectionate
and cold, generous and selfish. They are fond of
colours and perfumes and rich foods. They delight in the
Arts and Sciences, but as artists they will accomplish their
best work through inspiration and not through study or preparation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>They are, I am happy to observe, impatient and untruthful.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is, you may see, a day on which charming people are
born, who do what they please and lie about it afterwards to
save their credulous dear ones needless perturbation. A Fish,
a Water Bearer, a Lion, or a Virgin is allowed no such zodiacal
privileges. His course is plain before him and he must
follow it. But the Gemini! Each one of them is two! Nothing
can be expected of him (or them), and everything! He
can pleasantly make his way in the world, singing with Walt
Whitman:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Roses bloom and strawberry shortcake is in season. The
date is six months removed from Christmas in both directions
so that a plentitude of presents may be looked for. The
weather is usually delightful anywhere on the seventeenth of
June and the day may be suitably celebrated in several climes.
A wise young man of twenty-one, however, who claims this superior
birthday, would, I think, celebrate it in London. When
I say London, I mean the River: Windsor or Hampton Court
or Richmond will do. He will take a nice girl with him, a
neat flapper in a frock with a Liberty pattern, American boots,
a French hat, and a Japanese sunshade. Later he may marry
her if he likes, but it is better that he defer the ceremony until
after the celebration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two will sit on the balcony of some old inn with a romantic
name like the Star and Garter and observe the gay
scene on the Thames over the obstruction of flower boxes brimming
over with pansies, fuschias, mignonette, heliotrope, feverfew,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>daisies, petunias, geraniums, portulaca, phlox, verbenas,
candytuft, and other mid-Victorian posies. The girl will be
perfumed with Coty’s Vertige and the young man of twenty-one
will be garbed in white serge. His tie will be Chinese
blue and through its folds will gleam a sapphire. The two
will smoke Demetrino cigarettes and the two will drink Scotch
whisky and soda, just as if nothing had happened. Presently
hunger will become an emotion and I should suggest an English
mutton chop, with the kidney, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pommes frites</span></i>, and large
English green peas. There will be some conversation but not
too much.</p>

<p class='c000'>After luncheon the fellow will engage a boat and, placing
the young lady in the prow, her sunshade held at the right
angle, he will punt her up or down the river, skilfully manoeuvring
his craft between the intricacies of rival punts, all
of which bear rival young ladies with equally peerless sunshades.
Then the young man, if he still be wise and twenty-one,
and if his circumstances and his acquaintanceships and
the soviet government permit, will motor the young lady to a
country house where they will drink tea on the sloping lawn
under the spreading trees, casting lengthening shadows. So
they may celebrate, if such peaceful celebrations in the restful
aristocratic manner are possible in 1939, and they will both
be very happy when night, the warm embracing English night,
wraps the lawn in darkness. And about the night I shall give
them no advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not known where he came from nor what was his real
name. But because five willow-trees grew beside his house
he was called the Master of the Five Willows. He was a quiet
soul, content to pass through life without comment or ambition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though he loved reading he never probed for hidden meanings;
but when they revealed themselves to him his joy was
such that he forgot his dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He loved wine, but could seldom afford it. His friends
knew this and used to send for him whenever they had opened
a cask. On such occasions he went on drinking steadily till he
felt himself getting fuddled; then he went away. For he never
stayed anywhere longer than he wished to nor left sooner than
he chose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of his ruined house protected him neither from
wind or rain; his short jacket was tattered and tied in knots;
his bowl was often empty and his platter bare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet his books—written only to please himself and give the
world a few of his ideas—brought him happiness enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus heedless of failure, scornful of success, the Master
lived and died.</p>

      <div class='line'>When Punch had roared at the inn for days</div>
      <div class='line'>The walls went round in a ringing haze,</div>

      <div class='line'>Jake was the devil himself, the host</div>
      <div class='line'>Scratched in a book like a solemn Faust;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the lights like birds went swiftly round</div>
      <div class='line'>With a soft and feathery whistling sound.</div>
      <div class='line'>He seized the table with one great hand</div>
      <div class='line'>And a thousand people helped him stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Good-night!” a thousand voices said,</div>
      <div class='line'>The words like gongs assailed his head,</div>
      <div class='line'>And out he reeled, most royally,</div>
      <div class='line'>Singing, amid that company.—</div>
      <div class='line'>Luminous clocks above him rolled,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bells in the darkness heavily tolled,</div>
      <div class='line'>The stars in the sky were smoothly beating</div>
      <div class='line'>In a solemn chorus, all repeating</div>
      <div class='line'>The tick of the great heart in his breast</div>
      <div class='line'>That tore his body, and would not rest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Singing, he climbed the elusive street,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard far off his footsteps beat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Singing, they pushed him through the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he fell full length on the darkened floor....</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>But his head struck sharply as he fell</div>
      <div class='line'>And he heard a sound like a broken bell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, in the half-light of the moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>The twittering elvish light of June,</div>
      <div class='line'>A host of folk came round him there,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sheba, with diamonds in her hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Solomon, thrumming a psaltery,</div>
      <div class='line'>Judas Iscariot, dark of eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Satan and Faustus and Lorraine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Heliogabalus with his train....</div>
      <div class='line'>The air was sweet with a delicate sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Of silk things rustling on the ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jewels and silver twinkled, dim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Voices and laughter circled him....</div>
      <div class='line'>After a while the clock struck two,</div>
      <div class='line'>A whisper among the audience flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Judy before him came and knelt</div>
      <div class='line'>And kissed him; and her lips, he felt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were wet with tears.... She wore a crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And amethysts, and a pale green gown....</div>
      <div class='line'>After a while the clock struck three</div>
      <div class='line'>And Polly beside him, on one knee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaned above him and softly cried,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wearing a white veil like a bride.</div>
      <div class='line'>One candle on the sill was burning,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Faustus sat in the corner, turning</div>
      <div class='line'>Page after page with solemn care</div>
      <div class='line'>To count the immortal heartbeats there.</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow was the heart, and quick the stroke</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the pen, and never a word he spoke;</div>
      <div class='line'>But watched the tears of pale wax run</div>
      <div class='line'>Down from the long flame one by one.</div>
      <div class='line'>Solomon in the moonlight bowed,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Queen of Sheba sobbed aloud;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Like a madonna carved in stone</div>
      <div class='line'>Judy in starlight stood alone:</div>
      <div class='line'>Tears were glistening on her cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her lips were awry, she could not speak.</div>
      <div class='line'>After a while the clock struck four,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Faustus said “I can write no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve entered the heartbeats, every one,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the allotted time is done.”</div>
      <div class='line'>He dipped his pen, made one more mark,</div>
      <div class='line'>And clapped his book. The room grew dark.</div>
      <div class='line'>At four o’clock Punch turned his head</div>

</div>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Goethe</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>If a militia of genius should be formed on Parnassus, Goethe
would be the drum-major. He is so great, so majestic, so
serene, so full of talent, so abounding in virtue, and yet, so
antipathetic!</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Chateaubriand</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>A skin of Lacrymae Christi that has turned sour. At times
the good Viscount drops molasses into the skin to take away
the taste of vinegar; at other times, he drops in more vinegar
to take away the sweet taste of the molasses. He is both
moth-eaten and sublime.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Victor Hugo</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>Victor Hugo, the most talented of rhetoricians! Victor
Hugo, the most exquisite of vulgarians! Victor Hugo—mere
common sense dressed up as art.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Balzac</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>A nightmare, a dream produced by indigestion, a chill, rare
acuteness, equal obtuseness, a delirium of splendours, cheap
hardware, of pretence and bad taste. Because of his ugliness,
because of his genius, because of his immorality, the Danton
of printers’ ink.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h4 class='c015'><em>Poe</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A mysterious sphinx who makes one tremble with lynx-like
eyes, the goldsmith of magical wonders.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Dickens</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>At once a mystic and a sad clown. The Saint Vincent de
Paul of the loosened string, the Saint Francis of Assisi of
the London Streets. Everything is gesticulation, and the gesticulations
are ambiguous. When we think he is going to
weep, he laughs; when we think he is going to laugh, he cries.
A remarkable genius who does everything he can to make
himself appear puny, yet who is, beyond doubt, very great.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Sainte Beuve</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>Sainte Beuve writes as if he had always said the last word,
as if he were precisely at the needle of the scales. Yet I feel
that this writer is not as infallible as he thinks. His interest
lies in his anecdote, in his malevolent insinuation, in his
bawdry. Beyond these, he has the same Mediterranean features
as the rest of us.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Ruskin</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>He impresses me as the Prince of Upstarts, grandiloquent
and at the same time unctuous, a General in a Salvation Army
of Art, or a monk who is a devotee of an esthetic Doctrine
which has been drawn up by a Congress of Tourists.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>A Word from Kuroki, the Japanese</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>“Gentlemen,” said General Kuroki, speaking at a banquet
tendered to him in New York, “I cannot aspire to the applause
of the world, because I have created nothing, I have
invented nothing. I am only a soldier.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If these are not his identical words, they convey the meaning
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>This victorious, square-headed Mongolian had gotten into
his head what the dolichocephalic German blond, who, according
to German anthropologists is the highest product of
Europe, and the brachycephalic brunette of Gaul and the Latin
and the Slav have never been able to understand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Will they ever be able to understand it? Perhaps they
never will be able.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Love of the Workingman</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>To gush over the workingman is one of the commonplaces
of the day which is utterly false and hypocritical. Just as in
the 18th century sympathy was with the simple hearted citizen,
so today we talk about workingman. The term workingman
can never be anything but a grammatical common
denominator. Among workingmen, as among the bourgeoisie,
there are all sorts of people. It is perfectly true that there
are certain characteristics, certain defects, which may be exaggerated
in a given class, because of its special environment and
culture. The difference in Spanish cities between the labouring
men and the bourgeoisie is not very great. We frequently
see the workingman leap the barrier into the bourgeoisie, and
then disclose himself as a unique flower of knavery, extortion
and misdirected ingenuity. Deep down in the hearts of our
revolutionists, I do not believe that there is any real enthusiasm
for the workingman.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the bookshop of Fernando Fé was still in the Carrera
de San Jerónimo, I once heard Blasco Ibáñez say with the
cheapness that is his distinguishing trait, laughing meanwhile
ostentatiously, that a republic in Spain would mean the rule
of shoemakers and of the scum of the streets.</p>

    <div><em>By Mary Borden</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now that I’ve got back to the beginning, the night of the
10th of September, 1913, I find that I’ve told you all sorts of
things, almost everything of importance, except just what happened
that night. I’m afraid, in telling the story, I’ve got
into rather a muddle. It’s so difficult to keep distinct what I
felt and knew at various times, and what I feel and know now.
Now the war is on us, and my chief feeling is one of fear, not
any definite fear of Zeppelins or invasions, but a vague, dreadful
fear, an acute sense of insecurity. The world is shaking,
and its convulsions give one a feeling of having, to put it
vulgarly, gone dotty. It’s as though I saw all the tables and
chairs in my room moving about and falling over. Everything
that was stable and was made to hang on to, and sit down upon,
and lean against, is lurching. The great business of life seems
to be to sit tight, but one has a suspicion that even the law
of gravity may be loosed and that we shall find ourselves falling
off the earth. Before the 4th of August, people in their
secure little houses were enjoying their miseries and making
capital out of their difficulties, and splendidly gambling on
the future—the dark future that seemed so possible. Now
it is all changed. It appears that the conduct of life is largely
a matter of unconscious calculations. One says good-bye and
calculates that the chances are a hundred to one, that one
will meet this friend again. But when I said good-bye to
Binky the other day at the one o’clock from Victoria, the
chances were a hundred to one against his coming back. It’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a curious thing to have all the mathematics of life upset. It
makes one feel like being in a mad-house. The laughter of
Arch and Humpy rising in shrieks from the gardens seems
incredible and wonderful. The security of childhood becomes
the most precious thing on earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>So you see how difficult it is to remember what my feelings
were in 1913. I have told you about how the American quartette
descended on us at Saracens, and I’ve told you about
my clairvoyant moment at dinner, when I saw through them
all as though an X-ray machine had been turned on them. I
don’t want to go into all the complex impressions of their
personalities and the queer, surcharged atmosphere that their
minds altogether there, created in the house, because Louise’s
wretched mind dominated them all for me as the evening went
on, just as her voice drowned their voices and her tragedy
eclipsed their little troubles. Phyllis and Binky may have
been under a strain; no doubt they were. Pat may have been
uncomfortable, though I don’t believe he was. Claire, undoubtedly,
drew a certain sinister satisfaction from Phil’s helplessness.
But all those things scarcely count at all compared
to the dreadful tension stretched over Louise and Jim. I had
a feeling of something drawn round them, very tight, enclosing
them in a space like the inside of a balloon, where the gases
of their misery and distrust swelled to bursting. And the
final act was just the bursting of a bubble that had been
strained too long. And it seems, now, scarcely more important
in the sum total of the world’s tragedy than the bursting
of a toy balloon, buyable for a penny, and in competition with
the roar of armaments, scarcely more noisy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>And yet, if we are immortals, all of us, then it was, of
course, much more than that, and the amount of pain that
was mine afterward, and the cowardly giving in to the hopeless
boredom of life that resulted from it, all that will be
balanced up against me, I suppose. I suppose my giving in
to Ruffles, when I knew there was nothing in it, will be laid
up against me. I don’t know. I don’t care very much. It’s
so difficult to decide whether that sort of thing really matters.
To my father it would matter so terribly, and to Binky it
would—it did—matter so little. I could never tell from his
manner whether he accepted it in knowledge or was altogether
unaware. But it’s curious that Louise should have accused
me of the thing that hadn’t happened and was not going to,
because my father came to see us.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>“LETTERS OF A JAVANESE PRINCESS”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By Louis Couperus</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the letters of Raden Adjeng Kartini were published
in Holland, they aroused much interest and awakened a warm
sympathy for the writer. She was the young daughter of a
Javanese Regent, one of the “princesses” who grow up and
blossom in sombre obscurity and seclusion, leading their
monotonous and often melancholy lives within the confines of
the Kaboepatin, as the high walled Regent’s palaces are called.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought of India, or as we now say, perhaps more
happily, Java, had a strange fascination for me even as a
child. I was charmed by the weird mystery of its stories which
frightened even while they charmed me. Although I was born
in Holland, our family traditions had been rooted in Java.
My father began his official career there as a Judge, and my
mother was the daughter of a Governor General, while my
older brothers had followed their father’s example and were
officials under the Colonial Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>At nine years of age I was taken to the inscrutable and far
off land round which my early fancy had played; and I
passed five of my school years in Batavia. At the end of those
five years I felt the same charm and the same mystery. The
thought of Java became almost an obsession. I felt that while
we Netherlanders might rule and exploit the country, we
should never be able to penetrate its mystery. It seemed to
me that it would always be covered by a thick veil, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>guarded its Eastern soul from the strange eyes of the Western
conqueror. There was a quiet strength “Een Stille Kracht”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
unperceived by our cold business-like gaze. It was something
intangible, and almost hostile, with a silent, secret hostility
that lurked in the atmosphere, in nature and above all, in the
soul of the natives. It menaced from the slumbering volcanoes,
and lay hidden in mysterious shadows of the rustling
bamboos. It was in the bright, silver moonlight when the
drooping palm trees trembled in the wind until they seemed
to play a symphony so gentle and so complaining that it moved
me to my soul. I do not know whether this was poetic imagination
ever prone to be supersensitive, or in reality the “Quiet
Strength,” hidden in the heart of the East and eternally at war
with the spirit of the West. It is certainly true that the
Javanese has never been an open book to the Netherlander.
The difference of race forms an abyss so deep that though they
may stand face to face and look into each other’s eyes, it is as
though they saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Javanese woman of noble birth is even more impenetrable.
The life of a Raden Adjeng or a Raden Adjoe is a
thing apart. Even the Dutch officials and rulers of the country
know nothing of the lives of these secluded “princesses,” as
we like to call the wives and daughters of the Regents, though
they themselves lay no claim to a title which in Europe ranks
so high.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly a voice was heard from the depths of this unknown
land. It rose from behind the high protecting wall
that had done its work of subjection and concealment through
the ages. It was gentle, like the melodious song of a little
bird in a cage—in a costly cage it is true, and surrounded by
the tenderest care, but still in a cage that was also a prison.
It was the voice of Raden Adjeng Kartini, which sounded
above the walls of the close-barred Kaboepatin. It was like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the cry of a little bird that wanted to spread its wings free in
the air, and fly towards life. And the sound grew fuller and
clearer, till it became the rich voice of a woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was shut in by aristocratic traditions and living virtually
imprisoned as became a young “princess” of Java; but she
sang of her longing for life and work and her voice rose clearer
and stronger. It penetrated to the distant Netherlands, and
was heard there with wonder and with delight. She was singing
a new song, the first complaint that had ever gone forth
from the mysterious hidden life of the Javanese woman. With
all the energy of her body and soul she wanted to be free, to
work and to live and to love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the complaint became a song of rejoicing. For she
not only longed to lead the new life of the modern woman,
but she had the strength to accomplish it, and more than that,
to win the sympathy of her family and of her friends for her
ideals. This little “princess” lifted the concealing veil from
her daily life and not only her life, her thoughts were revealed.
An Oriental woman had dared to fight for feminism,
even against her tenderly loved parents. For although her
father and mother were enlightened for noble Javanese, they
had at first strongly opposed her ideas as unheard of innovations.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wanted to study and later to become a teacher to open
a school for the daughters of Regents, and to bring the new
spirit into their lives. She battled bravely, she would not give
up; in the end she won.</p>

<p class='c000'>Raden Adjeng Kartini freed herself from the narrow oppression
of tradition, and the simple language of these letters
chants a paean “From Darkness into Light.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The mist of
obscurity is cleared away from her land and her people. The
Javanese soul is shown simple, gentle, and less hostile than we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Westerners had ever dared to hope. For the soul of this girl
was one with the soul of her people, and it is through her that
a new confidence has grown up between West and the East,
between the Netherlands and Java. The mysterious “Quiet
Strength” is brought into the light, it is tender, human and
full of love and Holland may well be grateful to the hand that
revealed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This noble and pure soul was not destined to remain long
upon earth. Had she lived, who knows what Raden Adjeng
Kartini might not have accomplished for the well being of her
country and her people; above all, for the Javanese women and
the Javanese child. She was the first Regent’s daughter to
break the fixed tradition in regard to marriage; it was customary
to give the bride to a strange bridegroom, whom she
had never seen, perhaps never even heard of, until her wedding
day. Kartini chose her own husband, a man whom she
loved, but her happy life with him was cut short by her early
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is sometimes granted to those whom the gods love to
bring their work to fruition in all the splendour of youth, in
the springtime or the summer of their lives. To have worked
and to have completed a great task, when one is young, so
that the world is left richer for all time—is not that the most
beautiful of all the gifts of the gods?</p>

<p class='c006'>Harriet, meanwhile, had been coughing ominously at the
drop-scene, which presently rose on the grounds of Ravenswood,
and the chorus of Scotch retainers burst into cry. The
audience accompanied with tappings and drummings, swaying
in the melody like corn in the wind. Harriet, though she
did not care for music, knew how to listen to it. She uttered
an acid “Shish!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shut it,” whispered her brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must make a stand from the beginning. They’re talking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is tiresome,” murmured Miss Abbott; “but perhaps it
isn’t for us to interfere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Harriet shook her head and shished again. The people
were quiet, not because it is wrong to talk during a chorus,
but because it is natural to be civil to a visitor. For a little
time she kept the whole house in order, and could smile at her
brother complacently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her success annoyed him. He had grasped the principle
of opera in Italy—it aims not at illusion but at entertainment—and
he did not want this great evening-party to turn
into a prayer-meeting. But soon the boxes began to fill, and
Harriet’s power was over. Families greeted each other across
the auditorium. People in the pit hailed their brothers and
sons in the chorus, and told them how well they were singing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>When Lucia appeared by the fountain there was loud
applause, and cries of “Welcome to Monteriano!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ridiculous babies!” said Harriet, settling down in her
stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, it is the famous hot lady of the Apennines,” cried
Philip; “the one who had never, never before—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh! Don’t. She will be very vulgar. And I’m sure
it’s even worse here than in the tunnel. I wish we’d never—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lucia began to sing, and there was a moment’s silence. She
was stout and ugly; but her voice was still beautiful, and as
she sang the theatre murmured like a hive of happy bees. All
through the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">coloratura</span></i> she was accompanied by sighs, and
its top note was drowned in a shout of universal joy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the opera proceeded. The singers drew inspiration from
the audience, and the two great sextettes were rendered not
unworthily. Miss Abbott fell into the spirit of the thing.
She, too, chatted and laughed and applauded and encored, and
rejoiced in the existence of beauty. As for Philip, he forgot
himself as well as his mission. He was not even an enthusiastic
visitor. For he had been in this place always. It was
his home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harriet, like M. Bovary on a more famous occasion, was
trying to follow the plot. Occasionally she nudged her companions,
and asked them what had become of Walter Scott.
She looked round grimly. The audience sounded drunk, and
even Caroline, who never took a drop, was swaying oddly.
Violent waves of excitement, all arising from very little, went
sweeping round the theatre. The climax was reached in the
mad scene. Lucia, clad in white, as befitted her malady,
suddenly gathered up her streaming hair and bowed her acknowledgment
to the audience. Then from the back of the
stage—she feigned not to see it—there advanced a kind of
bamboo clothes-horse, stuck all over with bouquets. It was
very ugly, and most of the flowers in it were false. Lucia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>knew this, and so did the audience; and they all knew that
the clothes-horse was a piece of stage property, brought in to
make the performance go year after year. None the less did
it unloose the great deeps. With a scream of amazement and
joy she embraced the animal, pulled out one or two practicable
blossoms, pressed them to her lips, and flung them into
her admirers. They flung them back, with loud melodious
cries, and a little boy in one of the stage-boxes snatched up
his sister’s carnations and offered them. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che carino!</span>” exclaimed
the singer. She darted at the little boy and kissed
him. Now the noise became tremendous. “Silence! silence!”
shouted many old gentlemen behind. “Let the divine creature
continue!” But the young men in the adjacent box were
imploring Lucia to extend her civility to them. She refused,
with a humorous, expressive gesture. One of them hurled a
bouquet at her. She spurned it with her foot. Then, encouraged
by the roars of the audience, she picked it up and
tossed it to them. Harriet was always unfortunate. The
bouquet struck her full in the chest, and a little billet-doux
fell out of it into her lap.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Call this classical!” she cried, rising from her seat. “It’s
not even respectable! Philip! take me out at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sketch is, I take it, commonly supposed to be the easiest
form that a writer can use, and the bad sketch probably is.
The good sketch, on the other hand, is about the hardest, for
there is no time to go wrong, or, rather, in which to recover
if one does go wrong. Moreover, it demands a very faithful
objectivity, and a rare sensitiveness of touch. The good
sketcher does not bite off more than he or she can chew, does
not waste a word, and renders into writing that alone which
is significant. To catch the flying values of life, and convey
them to other minds and hearts in a few pages of picture may
seem easy to the lay reader, but is, I do assure him, mortal
hard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sketches in this, the first book of a young writer, are
so really good, that they should require no preliminary puff.
But the fact is that the reading public in America and England
get so few good sketches, indeed so few volumes of
sketches at all, that even the best work of this kind has unfairly
little chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>If I know anything and I am not alone in my opinion, the
writer of this book has a sympathetic apprehension of life,
and a perfection in rendering it which is altogether out of
the common. Those readers who want not snapshots but little
pictures, entirely without preciosity, extraordinarily sensitive
and faithful, and never dull, because they have real meaning
and truth, will appreciate this volume.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Those who don’t know the southern countryside of England,
and the simpler people thereof, will make a real acquaintanceship
with it through some of these unpretentious pages. And
the French sketches, especially, by their true flavour of French
life, guarantee the writer’s possession of that spiritual insight
without which art is nothing worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will beat the drum no more; for if the reader likes not
this mental fare, no noise of mine will make him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By E. W. Howe</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I was lately making a little automobile journey and met
Joe Ward, a high-priced man. We were passing through the
town of Centerville and stopped a moment to inquire the road
to Fairview.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened that the man we addressed was Joe Ward himself,
who said he was just about to leave for Fairview and
would show us the way if we would give him a ride.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he sat beside the driver and turned round and told us
about the farms we passed. He knew every farmer on the
way; how his crops were turning out and many other interesting
facts, for this man was a clerk in the New York Store
in Centerville and had been so employed nine years.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we came to a crossroad he would say “Straight
ahead” or “Turn to the right” to the driver and then tell
us something of interest about his work in the New York
Store. It seemed he was a very popular clerk; so popular,
indeed, that the proprietor of the Boston Store, the principal
opposition, had long wanted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I said to him frankly,” Joe Ward explained, “if you
get me you’ll have to pay a man’s wages. I’m no cheap skate.
I was born over on Cow Creek and no citizen of that neighbourhood
would think of going to Centerville without trading with
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here,” I thought, “is a very high-priced man.”</p>

<div id='i90'  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>I began wondering how much would induce him to leave
the New York Store. And he proceeded to tell us—he
couldn’t keep a secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides the pull I have on Cow Creek, my grandfather
is the leading farmer out the Fairview way and everybody
knows I control the best trade round Fairview. So I says to
Persinger, of the Boston Store: ‘If you get me you’ll get the
best, but you’ll have to pay me. I’m human like everybody
else; if you pay me I’ll work for you and do you all the
good I can, but we might as well understand each other first
as last—if you get me you’ll have to pay me. I’m no amateur.
If you get me you’ll have to pay me twelve dollars a
week.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it developed before we reached the next town that Persinger,
of the opposition store, wouldn’t stand an innovation
like that, so Joe Ward got out at Fairview and said he was
going back next morning to resume his work at the New
York Store.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>DOC ROBINSON</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have noticed that the people take as much delight in praising
a worthless man as they take in abusing a respectable one.
People say Doc Robinson, the town drunkard, was once a noted
surgeon in London; that he was engaged to a beautiful young
lady of New York, but gave her up because his parents objected,
and thus went to the dogs; that he has the best education
of any man in town; that he is a man of fine intellect; that
he is a younger son of a titled family in England, and that
when his brother dies he will become a duke.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked Doc up and discovered that the only notable thing
that ever happened in his life was that he attended a veterinary
college in Canada, where he was born on a farm and where
he lived until he came to this country to make horse liniment,
the basis of which, alcohol, he sweetened and drank, and thus
became a drunkard.</p>

of the little book worries me. A critic on this side has
said that my Prefaces to reprints of my earlier works are
of the nature of parting kicks, and I have no desire just now
to kick this poor innocent. That evil-tempered old woman,
Mother Nature, in one of her worst tantrums, has been inflicting
so many cuffs and blows on me that she has left me
no energy or disposition to kick anything—even myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trouble is that I know so little about it. Did I write
this book? What then made me do it?</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading a volume of Fors Clavigera I once came upon a
passage which sounded well but left me in a mist, and it relieved
me to find a footnote to it in which the author says:
“This passage was written many years ago and what I was
thinking about at the time has quite escaped my memory. At
all events, though I let it stand, I can find no meaning in it
now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Little men may admire but must not try to imitate these
gestures of the giants. And as a result of a little quiet thinking
it over I seem able to recover the idea I had in my mind
when I composed this child’s story and found a title for it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Blake. Something too of the semi-wild spirit of the child hero
in the lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Naught loves another as itself ...</div>
      <div class='line'>And, father, how can I love you</div>
      <div class='line'>Or any of my brothers more?</div>
      <div class='line'>I love you like the little birds</div>
      <div class='line'>That pick up crumbs about the door.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There nature is, after picking up the crumbs to fly away.</p>

<p class='c000'>A long time ago I formed a small collection of children’s
books of the early years of the nineteenth century; and looking
through them, wishing that some of them had fallen into my
hands when I was a child I recalled the books I had read at that
time—especially two or three. Like any normal child I delighted
in such stories as the Swiss Family Robinson, but they
were not the books I prized most; they omitted the very quality
I liked best—the little thrills that nature itself gave me,
which half frightened and fascinated at the same time, the
wonder and mystery of it all. Once in a while I got a book
with something of this rare element in it, contained perhaps in
some perfectly absurd narrative of animals taking human shape
or using human speech, with such like transformations and
vagaries; they could never be too extravagant, fantastic and
incredible, so long as they expressed anything of the feeling I
myself experienced when out of sight and sound of my fellow
beings, whether out on the great level plain, with a glitter of
illusory water all round me, or among the shadowy trees with
their bird and insect sounds, or by the waterside and bed of
tall dark bull-rushes murmuring in the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>These ancient memories put it in my mind to write a book
which, I imagined, would have suited my peculiar taste of that
early period, the impossible story to be founded on my own
childish impressions and adventures, with a few dreams and
fancies thrown in and two or three native legends and myths,
such as the one of the Lady of the Hills, the incarnate spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of the rocky Sierras on the great plains, about which I heard
from my gaucho comrades when on the spot—the strange
woman seldom viewed by human eye who is jealous of man’s
presence and is able to create sudden violent tempests to
frighten them from her sacred haunts.</p>

<p class='c000'>That’s the story of my story, and to the question in your
publisher’s practical mind, I’m sorry to have to say I don’t
know. I have no way of finding out, since children are not
accustomed to write to authors to tell them what they think of
their books. And after all these excuses it just occurs to me
that children do not read forewords and introductions; they
have to be addressed to adults who do not read children’s
books, so that in any case it would be thrown away. Still if
a foreword you must have, and from me, I think you will
have to get it out of this letter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By J. C. Squire</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was eleven o’clock at night. I was preparing to write an
essay. I was going to write it about a book. The book was a
good and a beautiful book; it filled me with the noblest
thoughts, made me a better man and fit for the most heroic
actions. It was full of sagacity, of sound reasoning, of imagination
checked by sense, of reflection shot through with vision.
It was not only a good book, but a large and solid book, a
book to be chewed like the cud, remembered and returned to,
a virtuous and courageous book, a book of mettle, a book of
weight. Unfortunately, or fortunately, just as I had finished
reading the book and was biting the end of my fountain-pen,
wondering how in God’s name I was to do it justice, I looked
out of my attic window. The trees stood dark across the road;
the river lay dark beyond the trees; but the light of the stars
was not the only light. On the horizon, behind some trees
and a house, glowing, reddening, rolling, there was a Fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>There may be people who, when they see Fire in the distance,
say, “Oh, what a pity! I hope the Insurance Company
will not suffer heavily”; or “What a waste of material.”
There may be people who say, “There is a Fire”—and then
go to bed. There may even be people who say, “Well, what
if there is a Fire?”—and turn grumpily to resume their
discussion about the Ethics of Palaeontology or the Finances
of a Co-operative Kitchen. If such people exist, I am not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>among them. When I saw this Fire I ran downstairs as hard
as I could pelt and knocked up a neighbour. I said to him,
“There is a Fire. Look!” He answered, “By Jove! so there
is.” I said, “It may be twenty miles away or two miles
away. The farther the bigger. If it is a long walk the compensation
is proportionate.” He said, “Wait a minute till I
put on my boots.” I said, “All right; but buck up or the
Fire may die down.” He hurried; and we started walking.
We did not know whither we were walking. All we knew
was, and this thought slightly depressed us, that the direction
of the Fire put out of the question any hope that it was the
Albert Memorial or the Queen Victoria Memorial that was in
process of combustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>We walked along the river, past the terrace and the cocoa-butter
factory, and the nuns’ school, and the creek, and the
boathouses. The glare increased steadily as we went. When
we reached the bridge it was in full view. An enormous factory
was blazing away on the edge of the river below the
bridge; the great span cut dark across the flames and the glow.
As we climbed to the bridge we saw that there was a thin row
of silent people leaning over the ironwork—looking at the
Fire. The stars were above them and the velvet dark sky;
the river flowed below them; a few hundred yards away great
flames and intervolved clouds of smoke poured out of a huge
building, the top windows of which were almost intolerably
bright. The roof had gone and the pillars of stonework between
the windows looked like the pillars of some ruined Greek
temple against a magnificent gold sunset. It was all gold
and blue; the moving gold and the still, all-embracing blue;
and the crowd said nothing at all. There was no sound except
when a great stretch of masonry fell in, and then there was a
swelling sigh like that which greets the ascent of a rocket at
a firework display. There was a wind, and it was chill; we
passed on over the bridge and descended to the tow-path on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the opposite bank. Along that path we went until we were
opposite the Fire. About eight people, very indistinct in the
gloom, were scattered amongst the waterside bushes. In front
of us a fire-boat took up its position. Below and around the
Fire little lights flashed; there were lights above the river
(which was at low tide); voices shouted terrifically from the
other bank; voices, addressed to ‘Arry, answered from the boat,
and made reference to a line. An engine began working;
hoses could be seen sending rising and falling sprays of water
against a blaze that seemed capable of defying all the water
in all the seas.</p>

<p class='c000'>There we stood, watching. Only one sentence did we hear
from our awed neighbours. There was a man who in the darkness
looked portly and moustached. He took his pipe out
of his mouth and said, optimistically, “Nice breeze; it <em>ought</em>
to fan it along.” “Along” meant an enormous oil warehouse
and wharf. Overhearing that remark, I told myself the truth.
The moral man in me, the citizen, the patriot, were all fighting
hard for supremacy. I was trying to say to myself: “This
may mean ruin to somebody; you ought to pray that it should
be got under at once”; and “How can you bear to see so
much painfully-won material wastefully consumed!” and
“This stuff would probably be useful at the Front; it has
employed labour; its loss may be serious; its replacement
may be difficult; Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany....”
But all that company of virtuous selves fought a losing
battle. Aloud or in quietness I (or they) could say all this
and much more; but the still, small voice kept on repeating,
“Don’t you be a humbug. It’s too good. You <em>want</em> this Fire
to spread. You want to forget what it all means. You will
be disappointed if the firemen got it under. You would
like to see the next place catch fire, and the next place, and
the next place, for it would be a devil of a great display.”
Peccavi; that was certainly so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>They got it under. They cornered it. Flames gave way to
a great smoke; the smoke grew and grew; the path and the
bushes faded from red into the indistinct hue of the starlit
night. The mental glow died down; we felt cold, and moved,
and walked towards home. And as we walked I meditated
on the glory of Fire, fit subject for a poet, refreshment for the
human spirit and exaltation for the soul. My emotions, when
looking at it, had not been entirely base; I had felt, not merely
a sensuous pleasure in the glories of that golden eruption
under the blue roof of night, but wonder at the energies we
keep under, their perpetuity and their source, and the grandeur
of man, living amid so much vastness and power, valiantly
struggling to cope with things greater than himself, save that
they have no souls. And I thought that in the perfect and
hygienic State where the firemen would find water, water
everywhere, where the Super-Hose would be in use, where
everything would be built of fireproof materials, and where
extinguishers of a capacity not conceived by us would be
available as a last resort, the wise sovereign would set apart
beautiful large buildings, all made of timber, filled with oil,
tar and sugar, surrounded with waste land and fronted by a
wide reflecting river, which would periodically be set on fire
for the consolation and the uplifting of men. I don’t want a
big Fire made impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I wondered why it was that fire on a huge scale had
never yet adequately inspired a poet. And then I thought
that poets had, after all, done as yet very little, considering
the materials that are daily displayed before them; and then I
found great comfort and courage in the thought that the commonplace
things, the things we all see and know, live by and
live with, have so far merely been skirted, and that the provinces
which remain to be explored and described and celebrated
by imaginative writers are endless, and that only corners
have as yet been spied into.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>By E. L. Grant Watson</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When I had completed my first book, I had a desire to write
a preface, but was so strongly advised to let the book carry
its own message that I refrained: with the result that only one
reviewer saw what I was driving at. Later when the book
was published in America, I was asked by my American publisher
to write the preface which at first I had desired to write.
Eighty per cent. of the American reviewers were not only
sympathetic, but intelligent. Having been given the key, they
read the book in the mood in which it was written. It seems
to me permissible to provide such a key.</p>

<p class='c000'>In writing this my third book, I have tried to portray a
process of spiritual emancipation, of a freedom which is not
content to find itself by any premature or artificial way of
denial. Emancipation of this kind is difficult enough even
for men; and for women, whose lives are, by nature of their
biological functions, more closely interwoven in the material
process, it is almost impossible. Yet sometimes it is achieved;
perhaps most frequently through long or intense suffering.
Yet all suffering ultimately entails joy; and so, also, through
joy. Such a form of deliverance from the difficult complex
of material things is not incompatible with the acceptance of
life. Indeed the mistake has too often been made, that through
<em>any</em> haphazard form of renunciation the spirit could find a
short cut to its own freedom. Only through the acceptance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of life can be attained a confidence strong enough for the
happiness and that deliverance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this story I have chosen a woman so sensitive to the
beauty of existence as to be conscious, through all her youth
and adolescence, of that veiled terror that lurks at the very
heart of beauty. Through fear she learns first humility, then
courage and at last attains the spiritual power that raises its
possessor above accident. And at each step her love for the
increasing light of her own spirit grows stronger. It becomes
more precious than even the unique love of woman for man.
It becomes the arbiter of life, determining with a confidence
unshaken by pity or desire the material limitations through
which it can best find expression.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>POSTSCRIPT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A number of books are scheduled for publication in October.
Some will doubtless be delayed, as manufacturing conditions
are still difficult and transportation none too certain. However,
I am bound to have out before the holidays three unusually
charming gift books.</p>

<p class='c000'>Van Vechten’s “The Tiger in the House” is the only complete
account in English of the domestic cat. It is Carlo’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnum opus</span></i> and I have made in it, I think, quite the handsomest
of all my books. A large octavo bound in half canvas
with purple Japanese Toyogami sides stamped in gold.
The text is set in Caslon old style type, and printed on India
Tint Art Craft laid paper and since no more of this is to be
manufactured till the indefinite future—if then—the edition
for 1920 consists of only two thousand numbered copies. The
book runs to almost four hundred pages, with bibliography
and index and there are thirty-two full pages of the most
charming cat pictures you ever saw. The price should be
seven-fifty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am peculiarly proud to offer “Seven Men” by Max Beerbohm—the
“incomparable Max.” These five stories were
published in London last year by William Heinemann, but my
edition will be different. For “Max” has given us an inimitable
appendix and six drawings to illustrate it and neither
text nor pictures have ever been printed before. Thus the
Borzoi “Seven Men” becomes a real “first” and an item for
collectors. On this account and because in order to give the
book the odd shape (square octavo) I wanted I had to have
the paper specially manufactured, the first printing consists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of just two thousand numbered copies. It will probably be
impossible to make further copies before next year. The probable
price—four dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>W. H. Hudson’s “A Little Boy Lost” is now accepted, I
fancy, as a classic for children of all ages. Dorothy P. Lathrop,
whom many of you will remember for her delightfully
imaginative pictures done last year for Walter de la Mare’s
“The Three Mulla Mulgars,” has illustrated the Hudson book
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>. The result is a singularly fine large octavo—wholly
successful, I think, as to paper, printing, and binding.
I hoped this would not cost more than five dollars, but I fear
the price must be set at six.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By the way, I should like readers to realize this: that I
try to make Borzoi Books as well as I know how. Then I
base the price on what they cost to make. I do not fix the
price first and then try to trim the quality so as to come
within that price.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Hergesheimer’s “San Cristobal de la Habana” is
not fiction. It is about Havana—full of the colour he loves
and of which he is a master—and Joe himself. It will please
and interest his friends; it will probably enrage his enemies.
But so engaging and candid a book will certainly be read.
The first edition at any rate will be printed on Warren’s India
Tint Olde Style paper and bound in half black cloth, with
Chinese Orange board sides spattered with gold. Three fifty
is the price and there will be a hundred numbered copies
printed on Strathmore Laid paper, specially bound and autographed
at seven-fifty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I planned Mencken’s “Prejudices” to be an annual affair
and the second series will be ready in October. It will be as
provoking (and I hope and believe as popular) as its predecessor,
though it will deal less with books and more with the
ideas underlying them. The price will remain, for the moment
anyway, two dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“The Gate of Ivory” is Sidney L. Nyburg’s latest and by
far his most ambitious novel. The scene is the Baltimore of
not so many years ago, and the story of Eleanor Gwynn, irresponsible,
but brimful of audacity and charm, and Allen
Conway, is close enough to the facts of a famous Maryland
scandal to start it fairly on the way to the success I think it
deserves. Two twenty-five, but as is likely to be the case with
many books, the price will have to go up with subsequent
editions, as a considerable increase in binding costs is expected
this fall as well as some increase in printing.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have the greatest confidence in Floyd Dell. He’s a different
fellow, though, and doesn’t seem to have anything like the
same kind of confidence in himself. But anyway last year I
got him to write “Were You Ever a Child?”—essays on
education as charming as their title, and now—at long last—I
have his first novel. “Moon-Calf” is a real book or I’m
sadly mistaken. It’s by far the best first novel by an American
that has ever been offered me. The scene is our Middle
West, and the story—obviously autobiographical—shows
the influence of H. G. Wells in a way that marks, I think, a
new note in our literature. Anyway I recommend “Moon-Calf”
to every reader who cares a damn for my opinion of a
novel; I want the book to sell so that Floyd Dell may be
amply encouraged to do its sequel (when you read it you’ll
see it has to have one). Probable price two-fifty.</p>

<p class='c000'>André Tridon’s “Psychoanalysis and Behavior” is rather
more of a real book than his first. It has a more organic
unity—reads easier and is all in all a more finished product.
Incidentally—though Tridon told me once that he was going
to rewrite his first book every year for a different publisher—“Psychoanalysis
and Behavior” duplicates <em>none</em> of the material
in “Psychoanalysis.” The price is two-fifty.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Atlantic Monthly</cite> occupies a unique position among
our magazines, and most publishers, I think, realize the recommendation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>that serialization in it carries to readers of books.
I am particularly glad, therefore, to say that Mr. Sedgwick
printed several instalments of “Letters of a Javanese Princess”
by Raden Adjeng Kartini in his magazine, where they
aroused a good deal of interest and discussion. The original
manuscript was very long and contained much indifferent material,
so under our direction the translator, Mrs. Symmers, cut
it down and prepared a careful, informing, introduction about
Kartini, who, by the way, was the youngest daughter of a
Javanese regent and probably the first feminist of the Orient.
Then at the suggestion of Mrs. Knopf, whose favourite book this
is, I asked Louis Couperus, the great Dutch novelist, to write a
special introduction for our edition. His pages, few, but
wholly charming, are an interesting feature of the book. A
square octavo: probable price, four dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have reason to believe that “The Foundations of Social
Science,” by James Mickel Williams, is a book that one can
justly term epoch-making. Anyway, the work represents almost
ten years out of the author’s life—years spent teaching
in a small college rather than a large one, because only there
could he hope to have sufficient time to devote to it. The
manuscript was read for the author, and offered me for publication
by an authority in whom I have the very greatest confidence—Charles
A. Beard, formerly Professor of Politics at
Columbia University and now director of the Bureau of Municipal
Research in New York. In his book Professor Williams
explains the human element in the motives of respect for
law and the causes of increasing disrespect; the economic and
political attitudes of employers on the one hand and labour on
the other; progressive and reactionary judicial attitudes, especially
with respect to labour legislation; the causes of national
feeling and international rivalry and the difficulties in establishing
a League of Nations. Ought not such a work prove of
value and interest to intelligent citizens today? It will be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>large octavo running to over five hundred pages and the price
will probably be six dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Last year Mr. Mencken got for me, and I published in his
<cite>The Free Lance Books</cite>, “Ventures in Common Sense,” by E.
W. Howe, of Atchison, Kansas. Immediately afterwards most
enthusiastic letters reached the author from the big editors in
the country—such men as Edward Bok, late of <cite>The Ladies’
Home Journal</cite>, John M. Siddall of <cite>The American Magazine</cite>,
Don C. Seitz of <cite>The New York World</cite>, as well as letters from
the presidents of very large corporations telling of their admiration
for Mr. Howe’s philosophy. It seemed to me then
as it does now that whether or not you agree with him—and
more than likely you will disagree—Mr. Howe should be
more widely known, particularly in the East. His unique
little monthly is read almost exclusively by the really important
people of the country, but the average man or woman
would find it highly entertaining. For “Ed” Howe is the
Middle West and the plain American incarnate and in his
new book, “The Anthology of Another Town,” he presents a
panorama, really, of a typically middle western small town.
The price is two dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very important event in the book world will be, I think,
the publication of a translation of Knut Hamsun’s “Hunger.”
It is difficult to say why Hamsun is not known, really widely
known, in the United States. A translation of one of his
books was published a few years ago. But those who know
Hamsun in the original seem to agree that “Shallow Soil”
was the worst possible novel to select for launching him in
America. I have been told of the greatness of Hamsun for
a full five years now and at last I am stirred to action. There
can be no question whatever that he is far and away the leading
Scandinavian writer of the day, and if one may judge from
the acclaim with which “Growth of the Soil” has been received
in England, one of the very greatest writers of our age.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>You can read about him in The Encyclopaedia Britannica
and you will learn there that “Hunger” is the book that first
made him famous—almost a generation ago. This competent
translation was first published in England in 1899, but
Edwin Bjorkman’s informing, useful introduction, was specially
written for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many who read this have doubtless already seen the little
printed fall announcements that went out from my office some
months ago. In some respects this announcement is inaccurate.
For example, I shall not publish de Bekker’s “Cuba.”
Mr. de Bekker was delayed in getting the manuscript written
and as the book required elaborate and special handling from
an advertising point of view—it was to carry much advertising
matter—I decided finally that since he was able to get
another publisher it would be better so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over a year ago I persuaded Dr. A. A. Goldenweiser of The
New York School for Social Research to undertake to write a
good general introduction to anthropology—for the average
reader. This was announced as “The Groundwork of Civilization,”
but as Dr. Goldenweiser has only just delivered his
manuscript, the book must go over until next year.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c000'>And now I would like to say something about my plans for
1921. In a general sort of way I want to give more attention
to the work of American authors and publish more American
books. American publishers show, I believe, altogether too
much deference to work that reaches us from England. Obviously
most of the time the young English novelist is a better
craftsman than the American, but there are springing up all
over the United States—in Detroit, St. Louis and Washington
as well as New York, men and women who do know how to
write and who have observed to advantage the life about them.
To bring forward work of this kind shall be my chief aim.
However, we must give the devil his due even if he be a foreigner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and I am quite sure that the feature of our spring list
(I cannot be positive of this because at the time of writing
negotiations are still in progress) will be our representation
in America of the great Danish house of Gyldendal. Gyldendal
were established in Copenhagen in 1770 and control today
the majority of the best books published in Denmark and Norway.
Not long ago they opened a branch in London especially
for the publication of English translations of the books
they control. I plan next spring to bring out the first of these,
as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Growth of the Soil,” by Knut Hamsun. H. G. Wells has
written Messrs. Gyldendal as follows regarding this novel:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Easton Glebe,</em></div>
      <div class='line in6'><em>Dunmow,</em></div>
      <div class='line in8'><em>June 18, 1920.</em></div>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Dear Sirs</em>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'><em>I have not yet written to thank you for sending me</em>
“Growth of the Soil” <em>and making me acquainted with the
work of Knut Hamsun. I am ashamed to say I have never
before read a book by this great writer and indeed I did not
know of his existence until now. It amazes me that he has so
long been kept from the English reading public and the sooner
you give us more of him the better I shall be pleased. I do not
know how to express the admiration I feel for this wonderful
book without seeming to be extravagant. I am not usually
lavish with my praise but indeed the book impresses me as
among the very greatest novels I have ever read. It is wholly
beautiful; it is saturated with wisdom and humour and tenderness;
these peasants are a triumph of creative understanding.
I have seen no reviews here that do justice to this work.
But I find my friends talking of it and, as it were, getting
up their courage to appreciate it at its proper value. Give us
one or two more books by Hamsun in English and our sluggish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>but on the whole fairly honest criticism will begin to realize
the scale he is built upon—I say as much.</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Very sincerely yours</em>,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>(<em>Signed</em>) <span class='sc'>H. G. Wells</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“The Song of the Blood Red Flower,” by the Finn, Johannes
Linnankoski—a poetical tale of love which has created a
veritable furor on the continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Grim,” from the Danish of Svend Fleuron, a remarkable
nature story—the life of a pike.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jenny,” by a Danish woman novelist, Sigrid Undset—to
my mind an intensely interesting feminist novel—honest, convincing
and moving.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Sworn Brothers,” a stirring tale of ancient Iceland,
by Gunnar Gunnarsson, the leading Icelandic novelist—and
a man who will bear watching. (His “Guest the One-Eyed”
will follow.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Once these books are out I expect that Gyldendal will send
me over four or six new ones each season.</p>

<p class='c000'>There will be two new detective stories by J. S. Fletcher,
entitled probably “The Chestermarke Instinct” and “The
Borough Treasurer,” as well as “The Wine of Life,” a novel
of the studio and the stage by Arthur Stringer, author of “The
Prairie Mother,” etc. Late in the season I expect to publish a
new book by E. R. Punshon, whose “The Solitary House”
was so well received two years ago. “Old Fighting Days” is
an exciting tale of adventure and of the ringside in England
in the days of Napoleon. These are books for entertainment
pure and simple, but the volume of animal stories, by Hal G.
Evarts, author of “The Cross Pull,” should be more than just
that;—in fact, of universal and compelling interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>January second should see the appearance of George Jean
Nathan’s new book, “The Theatre, the Drama, the Girls.” It
will be very similar to his last, “Comedians All,” quite his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>most successful—so far. At the same time John V. A.
Weaver’s book of poems in the American language, should be
ready. We are calling it “In America,” and it ought to attract
a great deal of attention. The poems tell for the most
part, good stories in the fascinating American vernacular.</p>

<p class='c000'>This will be followed after an interval with a book (as yet
unnamed) of characteristic light verse by “Morrie” Ryskind.
“Morrie” is one of the best-known contributors to F. P. A.’s
famous <cite>The Conning Tower</cite> in <cite>The New York Tribune</cite>, and
F. P. A. himself has had not a little to do with the getting
together of this book.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a great many years all sorts of people whose opinions
I respect have been talking to me about the novels of E. M.
Forster. Finally Mr. Galsworthy, when he was last over here,
told me about “Where Angels Fear to Tread,” which had never
been published in the United States. I issued it last year, and
although it did not have the sale I had hoped for, I am going
right on reissuing Mr. Forster’s novels. The next will be
“Howard’s End,” which has been out of print for a number
of years. The regard which competent critics have for Mr.
Forster’s work is very striking. A number of them, in fact,
feel certain that it is only a matter of time before Forster’s
work will be revived as has been that of Samuel Butler. We
shall see. Meanwhile I have two other novels by Forster in
line for publication, one of which has never been published
in America.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early last year I published “The Secret Battle,” a first
novel by A. P. Herbert, a young Englishman. The book to
me is still, as it was then, the very finest English novel that has
come out of the war. Mr. Herbert has written a second novel
entitled “The House by the River.” It is not, like “The Secret
Battle,” the overflow of an intense emotional experience—it
has nothing to do with the war. It is, in fact, a first rate murder
story and of a very unusual kind. But the style of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>book is there,—my, how the man can write—the style that
<cite>The Westminster Gazette</cite> said was “in many ways reminiscent
of Defoe’s ... the model of the plain tale ... in which no
artistic method of purpose obtrudes itself, but which nevertheless
makes a single decisive artistic effect on the reader.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some other poetry will be Richard Aldington’s “Medallions
in Clay,” translations mostly from the Greek; Conrad Aiken’s
“Punch: the Immortal Liar”—a splendid title I think—and
a volume by Michael Strange to be illustrated by John Barrymore.</p>

<p class='c000'>André Tridon will have a new volume entitled “Psychoanalysis,
Sleep and Dreams,” Joseph Hergesheimer expects to
gather into “The Meeker Ritual” those stories which attracted
so much attention when they appeared in <cite>The Century</cite>, and
H. L. Mencken’s “In Defense of Women,” at present out of
print, will be reissued—reset from an entirely revised manuscript.
Mencken’s “The American Language,” by the way,
greatly enlarged, revised and entirely reset, will be published
(probably in two large volumes) in the fall of 1921.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other books that I expect to have ready in the spring are
“Deadlock,” the sixth volume in Dorothy Richardson’s now
famous Pilgrimage Series, a fifth volume in Mencken’s The
Free Lance Books, “Democracy and the Will to Power,” by
James N. Wood, and a unique anthology of Devil Stories for
which the editor, Dr. Maximilian J. Rudwin, formerly of
Johns Hopkins University, has drawn on the literature of
many countries. Dr. Rudwin has planned a series of diabolical
anthologies of which this is to be the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could go on, I suppose more or less indefinitely unfolding
my plans for the future—they lay, didn’t Clarence Day say
earlier in this book, “like onions on rafters”—but one must
stop sometime and so I will speak only of two other books,
both of them really unusual.</p>

<p class='c000'>One, “In the Claws of the Dragon,” is a novel dealing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the marriage of an aristocratic young Chinaman—one of the
bureaucrats—to a well-to-do French girl. The author, George
Soulie de Morant is one of the most famous of French Sinologists,
and his book presents as well as a fascinating and exciting
story, a striking picture of life and customs in the country
of Po-Chui.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other book, “Children of No Man’s Land,” introduces
another young English novelist, G. B. Stern. The manuscript
was sent to one of my most trusted and capable readers.
Here is his comment: “This book is the most brilliant and
perfect study that exists of 1, the ultra-modern studio crowd,
and 2, the hyphenate in war time; and it touches with wonderful
deftness a variety of other matters—the Jews and Zionism;
patriotism and internationalism; marriage and free love;
heredity, convention and revolt.” I shall say no more, but I
reproduce here a little sketch made by H. G. Wells after reading
“Children of No Man’s Land”:</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
